  
This is not an alternative to xDrip+. I support xDrip+ (xDrip).  
This is complementary to the xDrip repository.  

You need the advice of a competent medical professional (endocrinologist) to control your diabetes. Neither xDrip nor this page provides that. There is no medical advice here.  

The instructions and guides here are based on my experience as a user, and someone who helps other users, of Dexcom G5 and G6 with xDrip. They are provided to help you use xDrip.
