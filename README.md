# xDrip
  
xDrip is an [open-source Android app](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip), developed, maintained and supported by volunteers, that you can use as a continuous glucose monitor (CGM).  
![](./docs/images/xDinaction.png)  
  
It lets you customize your alerts, follow (monitor) your child, parent or partner, perform statistical analysis, set targets, control and interact with different CGM devices, and a lot more.  
There is no financial incentive for any of the xDrip developers.  Each one of us either has diabetes or has a loved one who does.  We need and use xDrip ourselves.

Documentation, instructions and guides here are provided to help you use xDrip.  
You need the advice of a competent medical professional to control your, or your loved one's, diabetes. This site provides no medical advice.
