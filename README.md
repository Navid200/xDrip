# xDrip  

xDrip is an [open-source Android app](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip), developed, maintained and supported by volunteers, that you can use as a continuous glucose monitor.  
There is no financial incentive for any of us in what we do for xDrip.  Each one of us either has diabetes or has a loved one who does.  We need and use xDrip ourselves.
