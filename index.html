  <h1>xDrip Support</h1>
  <p>This is not an alternative to xDrip.
  I support xDrip.</p>
  <p>You need the advice of a competent medical professional (endocrinologist) to control your diabetes. Neither xDrip nor this page provides that. 
    There is no medical advice here.</p>
  <p>The instructions and guides here are based on my experience as a user, and someone who helps other users, of Dexcom G5 and G6 with xDrip. 
    They are provided to help you use xDrip.</p>
