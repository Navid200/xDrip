You can download xDrip as explained [here](./Download-xDrip.md).  
You can install any version of xDrip over your existing version as long as they are both official versions.  
  
You cannot install xDrip if you have an unofficial version of xDrip already installed on the same phone.  
If you attempt to install the official version, in that case, you will get a notification stating "App not installed".  
  
The only way to install the official version of xDrip is to first uninstall the existing unofficial version.  However, before doing that, you should [backup the database](./Backup-Database.md) so that you can restore your data after switching to the official version.  
  
After you have backed up the database, you can uninstall the unofficial version of xDrip.  Then, you can [install](./Install.md) xDrip.  
Then, you should [restore the database](./Restore-Database.md).
