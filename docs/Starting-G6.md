## Starting Dexcom G6 or Dexcom ONE
[xDrip](../README.md) >> [Features](./Features_page.md) >> [xDrip & Dexcom](./Dexcom_page.md) >> Starting G6 or Dexcom ONE  
  
Please be patient and do not rush to tap on "Start Sensor" even if xDrip encourages you to.  Please follow the steps exactly as stated below, in the specified sequence, to avoid common issues.  
If you see references here to functions you don't recognize, please have a look at [this](./Dexcom-Basics.md).  
  
If you have been using the Dexcom app, you need to disable it.  You cannot have two mobile apps collecting from the same transmitter at the same time.  
  
1.  If you are using an old version of xDrip, [update](./Updates.md) to the current stable release.  
  
2.  Set "G5/G6/G7/1 Transmitter" under &nbsp; Settings &#8722;> [Hardware Data Source](./HardwareDataSource.md).  
  
3.  Is there a "Start G6 Sensor" stuck in the queue on the G5/G6/G7 status page?  Please note that in the last step when you start sensor, there will be a "Start G6 Sensor" in the queue for one read cycle (up to 5 minutes).  That is expected and does not count as a stuck command.  A stuck command remains in the queue and does not clear.

If there is a command stuck in the queue, [clear the queue](./Clear-queue.md).  
  
4.  Adjust xDrip [settings](./G6-Recommended-Settings.md).  If you get a pair request at any point, please approve.  
  
5.  If "Start Sensor" isn't available as an option from the top left menu on the main screen, "Stop Sensor" from the same menu.  Wait 5 minutes.    
The transmitter needs to be detached from your body for at least 10 minutes before you proceed.  
The calibration code is printed on the adhesive cover of the sensor.  You will need it to start sensor.  
If there is bleeding, after inserting a new sensor, use Q-tips to absorb the blood.  Keep doing that, and don't allow any blood to get to the contacts, until bleeding stops.  
  
6.  If you are starting a new transmitter, enter the new transmitter serial number (Transmitter ID): Settings &#8722;> Dexcom Transmitter ID.     
  
7.  Clean the transmitter contacts (not if you are restarting sensor) using rubbing alcohol.  Wait for it (10 seconds) to dry.  Snap the transmitter into the sensor.  If you are starting a new transmitter, snapping it into the sensor on your body is required to activate it.  
  
8.  Monitor the G5/G6/G7 system status page. Every 5 minutes, a read cycle completes.  
If you don't have [proper connectivity](./Proper-connectivity.md), don't proceed before figuring out why. Perhaps, your settings are incorrect.
If you are starting a new transmitter, be patient and wait for the battery voltages to be populated before you proceed. It may take up to half an hour.  
  
10.  Start sensor.  Enter the 4-digit calibration code from the sensor adhesive cover when asked. Keep the code. In 2 hours, your readings will start with no need for initial calibrations.

If you are coming from G5, or another CGM, you need to get used to factory calibration.  Give it a chance.  Most people don't need to calibrate G6 as long as the calibration code is entered properly.  
  
A common mistake is to replace an old transmitter with a new one, stop sensor, change transmitter ID, and start sensor right away. This could result in the new transmitter never receiving the start command at the right time. The outcome is no readings after the 2-hour warm-up.  
  
Never soak (insert sensor a while before starting it) a G6 sensor. The main advantage of G6 over G5 is factory calibration. You will be interfering with factory calibration (accuracy) the longer it takes from the moment you insert the sensor to the moment you start the sensor in xDrip.  
  
The calibration code for each sensor is printed on the adhesive cover you have to peel off before you insert the sensor.  Don't throw it away.
