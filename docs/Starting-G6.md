## Starting Dexcom G6  
  
Please be patient and do not rush to tap on "Start Sensor" even if xDrip encourages you to.  Please follow the steps exactly as stated below.  
If you see references here to functions you don't recognize, please have a look at [this](./Dexcom-Basics.md).  
  
If you have been using the Dexcom app, you need to disable it.  You cannot have two mobile apps collecting from the same transmitter at the same time.  
  
The following steps let you start avoiding common issues:  

1.  If you are using an old version of xDrip, [update](./Updates.md) to the current stable release.  

2.  Set "G5/G6 Transmitter" under &nbsp; Settings -> Hardware Data Source.  

3. Is there a "Start G6 Sensor" stuck in the queue on the G5/G6 status page?

If yes, [clear the queue](./Clear-queue.md).  

4.  Adjust xDrip [settings](./G6-Recommended-Settings.md).  

5.  If "Start Sensor" isn't available, under the top left menu from the main screen, tap on "Stop Sensor". On the stop sensor page, tap on "STOP SENSOR".  Wait 5 minutes.    
If you are replacing the sensor, using your current transmitter, remove the transmitter from the old sensor.  The transmitter needs to be outside sensors for at least 10 minutes.
If there is bleeding, after inserting the new sensor, use Q-tips to absorb the blood.  Keep doing that, and don't allow any blood to get to the contacts, until bleeding stops.    

6.  If you are starting a new transmitter, enter the new transmitter serial number on the transmitter ID page: &nbsp; Settings&nbsp;&#8209;>&nbsp;Dexcom&nbsp;Transmitter&nbsp;ID.     

7.  Clean the transmitter contacts (not if you are restarting sensor) using rubbing alcohol.  Wait for it (10 seconds) to dry.  Snap the transmitter into the sensor.  

8.  Monitor the G5/G6 system status page. Every 5 minutes, a read cycle completes.  
If you don't have [proper connectivity](./Proper-connectivity.md), don't proceed before figuring out why. Perhaps, your settings are incorrect.  
If you are starting a new transmitter, be patient and wait for the battery voltages to be populated before you proceed.  It may take up to half an hour.    

9.   Only after establishing proper connectivity, only if you have waited for the queue to clear, and only after the voltages are showing on the system status page, should you start sensor.  For example, if you have stopped (previous) sensor, wait until you see "Stopped" on the G5/G6 status page.  
Carefully, enter the 4-digit calibration code from the sensor adhesive cover when asked. Keep the code if you intend to restart the sensor. In 2 hours, your readings will start with no need for initial calibrations.

 If you are coming from G5, or another CGM, you need to get used to factory calibration.  Give it a chance.  Most people don't need to calibrate a new G6 sensor as long as the calibration code is entered properly.  
 
A common mistake is to replace an old transmitter with a new one, stop sensor, change transmitter ID, and start sensor right away. This could result in the new transmitter never receiving the start command at the right time. The outcome is no readings after the 2-hour warm-up.  
  
Never soak (insert sensor a while before starting it) a G6 sensor. The main advantage of G6 over G5 is factory calibration. You will be interfering with factory calibration (accuracy) the longer it takes from the moment you insert the sensor to the moment you start the sensor in xDrip.
