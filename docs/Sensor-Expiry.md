#### **Show on main screen**    
You can have xDrip show when the sensor expires at the bottom of the main screen.  
To do that, bring up the [home shelf](./HomeShelf.md).  
  
Enable "Show Sensor Expiry".  
  
If you use a G5 in non-[native](./Native-Algorithm) mode, or if you use a G5 (or an old G6) and have enabled [preemptive restart](./Preemptive-Restart), your sensor will not stop.  But, if you enable this setting, it will show on the main screen that it will.  So, you should disable this setting in those cases.

#### **Notifications**  
You can enable sensor expiry notifications under [Alerts](./Alerts_page.md).  
When enabled, you will receive notifications 24 hours, 9 hours and 2 hours before expiry.
