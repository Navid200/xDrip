#### **Show on main screen**  
You can display the sensor expiry time at the bottom of the main screen in xDrip. To enable this feature:  
Bring up the [home shelf](./HomeShelf.md).  
Enable the `Show Sensor Expiry` option.  
  
If you are using a G5 in non-[native](./Native-Algorithm) mode, or if you are using a G5 (or an older G6) and have enabled [preemptive restart](./Preemptive-Restart), your sensor will not stop automatically. In such cases, enabling this setting will still show an expiry notification on the main screen. Therefore, you should disable this setting for these configurations.

#### **Non-intrusive Alerts**  
To activate sensor expiry alerts, navigate to: `Settings` &#8722;> `Alarms and Alerts` &#8722;> `Extra Alerts` &#8722;> `Sensor expiry`. When enabled, you will receive notifications 24 hours, 12 hours, 6 hours, and 2 hours before expiry.  However, alerts will only appear (and sound) when you connect or disconnect the phone charger or unlock the screen. Therefore, you will not receive alerts while you are sleeping.  
  
If you want alerts even while sleeping, you will need to set up a separate reminder or alarm. For example, you can use the Google Clock app to set an alarm.
