#### **Show on main screen**  
You can display the sensor expiry time at the bottom of the main screen in xDrip. To do this, follow these steps:  
Bring up the [home shelf](./HomeShelf.md).  
Enable the `Show Sensor Expiry` option.  
  
If you are using a G5 in non-[native](./Native-Algorithm) mode, or if you are using a G5 (or an older G6) and have enabled [preemptive restart](./Preemptive-Restart), your sensor will not stop automatically. In such cases, enabling this setting will still display an expiry notification on the main screen. Therefore, you should disable this setting if you are using these specific configurations.

#### **Non-intrusive Alerts**  
You can activate sensor expiry notifications through the following path: `Settings` &#8722;> `Alarms and Alerts` &#8722;> `Extra Alerts` &#8722;> `Sensor expiry`. When enabled, you will receive notifications 24 hours, 12 hours, 6 hours, and 2 hours before expiry.  However, each alert is delayed until you connect or disconnect the phone charger or unlock the screen. Therefore, you will not receive notifications while you are sleeping.  
  
If you want to receive notifications even while sleeping, you will need to set up a separate reminder or alarm. For example, you can use the Google Clock app to set an alarm.
