Why does music blast my ears when I am listening to music using my headphones and an xDrip alert triggers?  
  
Use Audio Focus to decide what should happen when an alert is triggered while another app is active.  
  
Access Audio Focus at Settings &#8722;> Alarms and Alerts &#8722;> Glucose Alerts Settings &#8722;> Audio Focus.
