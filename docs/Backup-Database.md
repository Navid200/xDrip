## Backup database  
[xDrip](../README.md) >> [Features](./Features_page.md) >> [Backup](./Backup.md) >> Backup xDrip database  
  
Do you need to uninstall xDrip?  If yes, you should backup the database and settings.  If you don't, you will lose all your blood glucose readings history, your alerts, and login and passwords.  
There is a limitation though.  You will not be able to import the database.  You can only restore it.  The existing database will be overwritten by the database that is restored.  

To backup, from the top right menu button on the main screen, tap on Import /Export features &#8722;> Export database  
This will execute the following two tasks.  
  
1- Saves the entire database to Internal storage &#8722;> xdrip &#8722;> exportxxxxxxxx-xxxxxx.zip  
The database contains all your previous readings as well as all your alerts.  
  
2- Saves settings to Internal storage &#8722;> Download &#8722;> xDrip-export  
The settings contain what you have changed to customize xDrip.  For example, if you have modified the colors using the [legend](./Legend.md).
