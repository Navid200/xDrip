## Backup database  
[xDrip](../README.md) >> [Features](./Features_page.md) >> [Backup](./Backup.md) >> Backup database  
  
Do you need to uninstall xDrip?  If yes, you should backup the database and settings.  If you don't, you will lose all your blood glucose readings history, your alerts, and login and passwords.  
There is a limitation though.  You will not be able to import the database.  You can only restore it.  The existing database will be overwritten by the database that is restored.  

To backup, from the top right menu button on the main screen, tap on Import /Export features &#8722;> Export database  
This will execute two tasks:  
1- Saves the entire database to Internal storage &#8722;> xdrip &#8722;> exportxxxxxxxx-xxxxxx.zip  
The database contains all your previous readings as wellas all your alerts.  
  
2- Saves settings to Internal storage &#8722;> Download &#8722;> xDrip-export  
The settings contain what you have changed to customize xDrip.  For example, if you have modified the colors using the [legend](./Legend.md).  On a new phone, you are better off using the source wizard, which will choose all the correct settings for your collector.
