## Backup database

Do you need to uninstall xDrip?  If yes, you should backup the database and settings.  If you don't, you will lose all your blood glucose readings history, your alerts, and login and passwords.  
There is a limitation though.  You will not be able to import the database.  You can only restore it.  The existing database will be overwritten by the database that is restored.  

To backup, you can either use the legacy database backup utility as explained below, or the [Google Drive backup](./GoogleDriveBackup.md) utility.

#### **Legacy database backup**  
From the top right menu button on the main screen, tap on `Import /Export features` &#8722;> `Export database`  
This will execute the following two tasks.  
  
1- Saves the entire database to Internal storage &#8722;> xdrip &#8722;> exportxxxxxxxx-xxxxxx.zip  
The database contains all your previous readings.  
  
2- Saves settings to Internal storage &#8722;> Download &#8722;> xDrip-export  
The settings contain what you have changed to customize xDrip.  That includes alerts, display settings, cloud upload settings, hardware data source settings, etc.
