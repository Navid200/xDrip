## Backup database  
  
Do you need to uninstall xDrip?  If yes, you should backup the database and settings.  If you don't, you will lose all your blood glucose readings history, your alerts, and login and passwords.  

To backup, from the top right menu button on the main screen, tap on Import /Export features &#8722;> Export database  
This will execute two tasks:  
1- Saves the database to Internal storage &#8722;> xdrip &#8722;> exportxxxxxxxx-xxxxxx.zip  
2- Saves settings to Internal storage &#8722;> Download &#8722;> xDrip-export
