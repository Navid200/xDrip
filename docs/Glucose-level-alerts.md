[xDrip](../README.md) >> [xDrip Alerts](./Alerts_page) >> [Glucose Level Alerts List](./Glucose-level-alerts)  
  
The first xDrip alerts are on this list.  You can access them at Settings &#8722;> Alarms and Alerts &#8722;> Glucose Level Alerts List.  
Tap on "Create Low Alert" or "Create High Alert" to create new alerts.  Long press on an existing alert to edit it.  

The volume for these alerts is defined by [Alert Volume Profile](./Volume-profiles.md).  Only the alerts on this list ignore the phone volume setting.
