## Glucose Level Alerts List  
[xDrip](../README.md) >> [Features](./Features_page.md) >> [xDrip Alerts](./Alerts_page.md) >> Glucose Level Alerts List  
  
The first xDrip alerts are on this list.  You can access them at `Settings` &#8722;> `Alarms and Alerts` &#8722;> `Glucose Level Alerts List`.  
Tap on `Create Low Alert` or `Create High Alert` to create new alerts.  Long press on an existing alert to edit it.  

The volume for these alerts is defined by [Alert Volume Profile](./Volume-profiles.md).  Only the alerts on this list ignore the phone volume setting.
