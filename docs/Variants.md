## Variants  
[xDrip](../README.md) >> [Download & Installation](./Installation_page.md) >> xDrip Variants  
  
You cannot install multiple instances of xDrip on the same phone. However, xDrip variants have different names, allowing you to install xDrip and one or more variants simultaneously. This effectively enables you to run multiple instances of xDrip on the same device, each for tracking different individuals.

#### **Which is which**  
  
- Basic notifications  
The basic notifications are already identified by the name of the app as highlighted in the following screenshot example.  So, you don't need to do anything for that.

- Alerts  
Name the alerts in each app according to the person you are following.  For example, name the low alert in the main app "HanselLow" while naming the low alert in the variant "GretelLow".  Now, when you get a low alert, you can tell whom the alert is for.

- Icons  
The icons are clearly identified.

- Which xDrip do I have open?  
You can customize the navigation bar and/or the title bar colors, as shown [here](./Legend.md).  Then, it may be easier for you to tell which app you are in.
