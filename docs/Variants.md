## Variants  
[xDrip](../README.md) >> [Download & Installation](./Installation_page) >> Variants  
  
You cannot install xDrip multiple times on the same phone.  But, xDrip variants have different names.  So, you can install xDrip and an xDrip variant or even more.  This effectively lets you install multiple instances of xDrip on the same phone.  
  
You can use each instance to follow a different person.  
  
You can download nightly variants [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6mvYVNVC-fOWkxnVF80dlFabjQ?resourcekey=0-ebguuiPuB1wUI9Rp2zjMNg).

#### **Identify basic notifications**  
The basic notifications are already identified by the name of the app as highlicghted in the following screenshot example.  So, you don't need to do anything for that.

#### **Identify Alerts**  
Name the alerts in each app according to the person you are following.  For example, name the low alert in the main app "HanselLow" while naming the low alert in the variant "GretelLow".  Now, when you get a low alert, you can tell whom the alert is for.
