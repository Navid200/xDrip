## Variants  
[xDrip](../README.md) >> [Download & Installation](./Installation_page.md) >> xDrip Variants  
  
You cannot install multiple instances of xDrip on the same phone. However, xDrip variants have different names, allowing you to install xDrip and one or more variants simultaneously. This effectively enables you to run multiple instances of xDrip on the same device, each for tracking different individuals.

- Alerts  
Name the alerts in each app according to the person you are following. For example, label the low alert in the main app as “HanselLow” and the low alert in the variant as “GretelLow.” This helps you identify which user the alert is for.

- Icons  
Icons are clearly identified within the app, making it easy to distinguish between different instances.
