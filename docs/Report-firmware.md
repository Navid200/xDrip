## Report Firmware
[xDrip](../README.md) >> [Features](./Features_page.md) >> [xDrip & Dexcom](./Dexcom_page.md) >> Report firmware  
  
If the firmware version, on the system status page, is unknown and should be reported, see this [page](./Firmware-versions.md).  

1. If the firmware version is listed, install the suggested xDrip release or any xDrip version released after that.  No need to uninstall first.  No need to report.  You can check the [classic](./xDrip-Version.md) status page to find out what version of xDrip you are currently running.  
xDrip needs to know what firmware your transmitter has.  If it doesn't, you may not get the functionality the xDrip developers intend for your transmitter.  So, please update.  

2. If the firmware version is not listed, and you are using the current stable release or one that's more recent, please post in the [Discussions](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/discussions).  Please add a screenshot of your system status page.  You can blackout the serial number.  But, please leave the first two characters visible.
