## Volume Profiles 
  
You can select a volume profile at Settings &#8722;> Alarms and Alerts &#8722;> Glucose Alerts Settings &#8722;> Alert Volume Profile.  
The selected volume profile will determine the volume for all your Glucose level alerts, which you can find under Settings &#8722;> Alarms and Alerts &#8722;> Glucose Level Alerts List.  
The rest of the xDrip alerts, not on that list, are not affected by the volume profile setting.
