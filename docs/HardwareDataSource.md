## Hardware Data Source
[xDrip](../README.md) >> [Features](./Features_page.md) >> xDrip Hardware data source  
  
A very important xDrip settings page is the Hardware data source page.  You can access it under the main xDrip Settings page.

On this page, you tell xDrip where the incoming data is coming from.  
  
When you install xDrip for the first time, Source wizard runs.  If you answer the questions Source wizard asks you, it will choose the correct Hardware data source for you.
