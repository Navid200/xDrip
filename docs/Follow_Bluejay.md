Work in progress!

<!--  
Bluejay, by default, uses the medical slot of a G6.  If you have another device or app occupying the phone slot and cannot use xDrip to collect from your G6, you can set up xDrip to receive readings from your Bluejay.  This will only work when the phone (xDrip) and Bluejay are physically close.  It will not work over the internet.  
  
You first need to set up your Bluejay as an independent collector.  
Then, you should select "640G / EverSense" as the xDrip hardware data source.
