#### **Stable Release**  
You can download the latest stable version under `Latest` from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip).  
On a mobile, you will need to scroll almost all the way down to reach `Latest`.

#### **Nightly Releases**  
You can access the nightly builds (least tested but more recent) from `Rreleases` on the same [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip) page.

#### **What to download**
After accessing the release you want, you will see something like this after expanding `Assets`:

Download the file with .apk at the end.  If there are multiple files with .apk at the end, download the one without [`variant`](./Variants.md) included in the name.
