## Connectivity troubleshooting  
  
Don't randomly tweak the xDrip settings hoping to get it going.  

If you are using G5 or G6, please ensure your settings match the recommended [G5 settings](./G5-Recommended-Settings.md) or [G6 settings](./G6-Recommended-Settings.md) respectively.  

Then, have a look at the [general information](./Dexcom-Basics.md) to familiarize yourself with the interface and requirements and limitations.  

If there is another mobile device set to collect from the same transmitter (not a follower, but a master), you need to disconnect it.  

The G5/G6 status page gives you most of the information you need about how your system (xDrip, Dexcom transmitter and sensor) is doing.

Is there [proper connectivity](./Proper-connectivity.md)?  If not, you need to resolve that before anything else. 
 Don't waste your time starting the sensor.  If there is a command stuck in the queue, [clear](./Clear-queue.md) the queue.  

If there is no proper connectivity, if you don't see "scanning" on the G5/G6 status page, you should tap on "Restart Collector" on the classic status page.  You may need to approve a pair request, which may come up any time up to 5 minutes after tapping on restart collector.  
If there is still no proper connectivity, change the last character of the transmitter ID and apply.  Then, change it back.  Now, the system status page should show hunting transmitter.  It should connect.
