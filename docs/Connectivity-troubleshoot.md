Don't randomly tweak the xDrip settings hoping to get it going.  
Disable [engineering mode](./Engineering-Mode.md).  

If you are using G5 or G6 (or Dexcom One), please ensure your settings match the recommended [G5 settings](./G5-Recommended-Settings.md) or [G6 (or Dex1) settings](./G6-Recommended-Settings.md) respectively.  

Enable all xDrip notifications under Android Settings &#8722;> Apps & notifications &#8722;> Notifications &#8722;> xDrip+.  Otherwise, you may not get a pair request notification, which you will need to approve.  

If you are new to xDrip or Dexcom, have a look at the [general information](./Dexcom-Basics.md) to familiarize yourself with the interface and requirements and limitations.  

If there is another mobile device set to collect from the same transmitter (not a follower, but a master), you need to disconnect it.  

The G5/G6 status page gives you most of the information you need about how your system (xDrip, Dexcom transmitter and sensor) is doing.

Is there [proper connectivity](./Proper-connectivity.md)?  If not, you need to resolve that before anything else. 
 Don't waste your time starting the sensor.  If there is a command stuck in the queue, [clear](./Clear-queue.md) the queue.  

If there is no proper connectivity, if you don't see "scanning" on the G5/G6 status page, you should tap on "Restart Collector" on the classic status page.  You may need to approve a pair request, which may come up any time up to 5 minutes after tapping on restart collector.  
If there is still no proper connectivity, [trigger a pair request](./MissedPairRequest.md).  It should connect.

**Asking for Help**  
If you are still having trouble, you can [ask for help](./Contact.md).
