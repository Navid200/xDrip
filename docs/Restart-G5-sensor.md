## Restart G5 Sensor  
  
You should not need to restart a G5 sensor manually.  
If you use it in non-native mode, the sensor will keep working and will not stop after 7 days.  
If you use it in native mode, you can use preemptive restart.  
  
However, there are times you may end up with a setup that is not working and in order to get it going, you will need to start again (restart).  
As long as you have inserted the sensor more than 2 hours ago, you won't need to have to wait 2 hours for warm-up.  What you should do in that case is to start and when you are asked when you inserted the sensor, you should enter the time for 2 hours ago.  
Then, in 15 minutes, you will be asked for entering initial calibrations.  
But, you should only do this if you have inserted the sensor more than 2 hours ago.  You should never do this for a sensor that you have just inserted.  In that case, you should go though the regular 2-hour warm-up to avoid extremely noisy readings.
