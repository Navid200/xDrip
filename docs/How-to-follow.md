## How to follow  
  
There are several options for following someone's readings as well as using xDrip when using another device or app as the collector.  
  
### 1. [xDrip Sync Follower](./xDripSync.md) (needs internet except Desert Sync)  
This is easy to set up.  But, it relies on Google.  
<br/>  
  
### 2. Nightscout Follower (needs internet)  
This requires Nightscout to be [set up](./Nightscout.md).  
After a Nightscout account has been created and set up, enter the required [settings](./Nightscout-Settings.md) so that the master starts uploading to Nightscout.  

On the follower, tap on Settings &#8722;> Hardware Data Source &#8722;> Nightscout Follower.  
Tap on Settings &#8722;> Nightscout Follow URL, and enter https<nolink>://userID.herokuapp.com, where userID is the master Nightscout user ID.  
<br/>  
  
### 3. Dex Share Follower (needs internet)  
This is an option if the master must be a Dexcom app, for example, if the master is an iPhone.  

On the follower, tap on Settings &#8722;> Hardware Data Source &#8722;> Dex Share Follower.  
Tap on Settings &#8722;> Share Username, to enter username.  
Tap on Settings &#8722;> Share Password, to enter the Dex share password.  
<br/>  
  
### 4. [Follow](./DexcomAppxDrip.md) Build your own Dexcom app  
If you use the [Build your own Dexcom app](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScD76G0Y-BlL4tZljaFkjlwuqhT83QlFM5v6ZEfO7gCU98iJQ/viewform?fbzx=2196386787609383750&fbclid=IwAR2aL8Cps1s6W8apUVK-gOqgGpA-McMPJj9Y8emf_P0-_gAsmJs6QwAY-o0) on the same phone as xDrip, you will not need internet access because you will be able to use local broadcast.  
<br/>  
  
### 5. Companion  
If you use CamAPS or the official Dexcom app as the collector, you can use xDrip on the same phone with no internet access.  
This option lacks back-fill capability.
