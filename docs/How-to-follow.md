### **[xDrip Sync Follower](./xDripSync.md)** (needs internet except Desert Sync)  
This is easy to set up.  It relies on Google.  
<br/>  
  
### **Nightscout Follower** (needs internet)  
This requires Nightscout to be [set up](./Nightscout_page.md).  After Nightscout has been set up, you need to set up your uploader.  If xDrip is your uploader, these are the required [settings](./Nightscout-Settings.md).  

These are the [follower instructions](./Follow/FollowNightscout.md).    
<br/>  
<br/>  
  
### **Dex Share Follower** (needs internet)  
This is an option if the master must be a Dexcom app.  
  
On the follower, tap on `Settings` &#8722;> `Hardware Data Source` &#8722;> `Dex Share Follower`.  
<br/>  
  
### **[Follow](./DexcomAppxDrip.md) Build your own Dexcom app**  
If you use the Build your own Dexcom app on the same phone as xDrip, you will not need internet access because you will be able to use local broadcast.  
<br/>  
  
### **[Companion App](./Follow/CompanionApp.md)**  
If you use CamAPS or the official Dexcom app as the collector, you can use xDrip on the same phone with no internet access.  
<br/>  
  
### **[Web Follower](./Libre3_Follow.md)** (needs internet)  
If you use Libre 3, you can use this option to have readings in xDrip.
