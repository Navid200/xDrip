### **[xDrip Sync Follower](./xDripSync.md)** (needs internet except Desert Sync)  
This is easy to set up.  
<br/>  
  
### **Nightscout Follower** (needs internet)  
This requires Nightscout to be [set up](./Nightscout_page.md).  After Nightscout has been set up, you need to set up your uploader.  If xDrip is your uploader, these are the required [settings](./Nightscout-Settings.md).  

These are the [follower instructions](./Follow/FollowNightscout.md).

### **Dex Share Follower** (needs internet)  
This is an option if the master must be a Dexcom app.  
  
On the follower, tap on `Settings` &#8722;> `Hardware Data Source` &#8722;> `Dex Share Follower`.  
<br/>    
  
### **[Web Follower](./Libre3_Follow.md)** (needs internet)  
If you use Libre 3, you can use this option to have readings in xDrip.
