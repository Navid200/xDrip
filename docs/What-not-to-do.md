## What not to do!
[xDrip](../README.md) >> [Features](./Features_page) >> [xDrip & Dexcom](./Dexcom_page) >> What not to do  
  
**Don't remove a transmitter from the box until you intend to use it.**  
As soon as you place the transmitter in a sensor, or even if you just touch the contacts long enough, the counter (on the transmitter) starts counting the number of days.  Since the number of days you can use a transmitter is [limited](./Transmitter-lifetime.md), don't start the counter unless you intend to start using the transmitter.  The best practice is to keep the transmitter in the box until you intend to use it.  

**Don't throw away the sensor adhesive covers**
The calibration code you need to start is printed on one of them.  

**Don't start a sensor on a new G6 transmitter before voltages are shown.**  
Only start a sensor after you have established [connectivity](/Proper-connectivity.md), and can see the voltages reported on the system status page as explained.  
When you first establish connectivity to a transmitter, it will take a few read cycles for everything to be properly synced.  You can start a sensor right away.  You shouldn't!  See the [details](./Starting-G6.md).  

**Don't start a G6 sensor unless ...**  
Before you start a sensor, the transmitter must have been outside a sensor for at least 10 minutes.  Otherwise, the transmitter will conclude that you are attempting to restart and will fail.  
A mistake some make with G6 is to place a new sensor on with the previous sensor still running.  Then, they stop the old sensor, remove the transmitter and snap it into the new sensor, right away, and start.  Even though the sensor is a new sensor, since the transmitter has not been kept out of both sensors for at least 10 minutes, the transmitter will stop the new sensor and issue an error.  

**Don't calibrate to correct more than a 20% error in one shot.**  
Otherwise, you may get a confused calibration error.  Please calibrate as explained [here](./Calibrate-G6.md).  

**Don't stop sensor thinking you can restart easily.**

**When you get a new phone, ...**   
Don't forget to [disable collection](./Stop-xDrip.md) on the old phone.  Otherwise, both phones will have constant connectivity issues.  

**Don't restart** a G6 sensor unless you understand the risks and accept responsibility for the possible consequences.  The manufacturer does not approve of restarting sensors.  You need to read all the [details and consequences of a restart](./Restart-G6-sensor.md) and understand that the readings will be incorrect after a restart.  I don't encourage anyone to restart sensors, or anything else the manufacturer does not approve.
