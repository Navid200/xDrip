## Snooze  
[xDrip](../README.md) >> [Features](./Features_page.md) >> [xDrip Alerts](./Alerts_page.md) >> Snooze   
  
If the phone is unlocked, the easiest way to snooze an alert is to just swipe right on the corresponding notification.  

If you want to be able to snooze an alert the same way with the screen locked, go to Android Settings &#8722;> Apps & notifications &#8722;> Notifications &#8722;> Notifications on lock screen.  You will see 3 options.  They will have different wordings depending on the manufacturer.  The following image shows an example:

Choose the least restrictive option.  Then, notifications can be swipted right to snooze the alert even when the screen is locked.  
  
If you enable Settings &#8722;> Alarms and Alerts &#8722;> Glucose Alert Settings &#8722;> Buttons silence alarms, pressing a volume button, after unlocking the phone and when in the app only, will snooze an alert.  
  
There is no need to open xDrip and access the "Snooze Alert" item from the menu unless you need to choose a snooze period different from the default.
