## Snooze

There is no way to snooze an alert if the phone is locked.  
After unlocking the phone, the easiest way to snooze an alert is to just swipe right on the notification.  
  
If you enable Settings &#8722;> Alarms and Alerts &#8722;> Glucose Alert Settings &#8722;> Buttons silence alarms, pressing a volume button, after unlocking the phone and when in the app, will also snooze an alert.  
  
There is no need to open xDrip and access the "Snooze Alert" item from the menu unless you need to choose a snooze period different from the default.
