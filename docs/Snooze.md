## Snooze

If the phone is unlocked, the easiest way to snooze an alert is to just swipe right on the corresponding notification.  

If you want to be able to snooze an alert the same way with the screen locked, go to Android Settings &#8722;> Apps & notifications &#8722;> Notifications &#8722;> Notifications on lock screen.  You will see 3 options.  They will have different wordings depending on the manufacturer.  The following image shows an example:

Choose the least restrictive option.  Then, notifications can be swipted right to snooze the alert even on the lock screen.  
  
If you want the lock screen to automatically show when an alert triggers, without having to press on the power button, enable Settings &#8722;> Alarms and Alerts &#8722;> Glucose Alerts Settings &#8722;> Wake Screen.  
  
There is no need to open xDrip and access the "Snooze Alert" item from the menu unless you need to choose a snooze period different from the default.
