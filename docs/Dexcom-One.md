If the serial number of your transmitter starts with 5, see below.  If it starts with C, xDrip does not support it yet.  In that case, your only option, until support is added, is to use xDrip in [Companion app mode](./Follow/CompanionApp.md).  

If you are using Dexcom One and want to use xDrip as a collector, make sure to at least use the latest [Stable](./Updates.md) release of xDrip.  
Under Hardware Data Source, choose "G5/G6 Transmitter".  
Follow all guides, recommendations and instructions written for "G6" [here](./Dexcom_page).
