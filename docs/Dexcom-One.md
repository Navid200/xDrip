If you are using Dexcom One and want to use xDrip as a collector, make sure to at least use the latest [Stable](./Updates.md) release of xDrip.  If the transmitter serial number starts with C, you will need an xDrip release of January 12, 2023 or more recent.  
Under Hardware Data Source, choose "G5/G6 Transmitter".  
Follow all guides, recommendations and instructions written for "G6" [here](./Dexcom_page).
