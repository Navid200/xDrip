## Session in progress

If you have a Dexcom session running already that was started using another phone or another app or a medical device, and you like to access and control it using xDrip, you can do that easily.  You don't need to start a new or the existing sensor for that.  
<br/>  
  
1. If there is another mobile or app that is currently controlling the transmitter, you either need to disable it or be outside its range. This does not include the Dexcom receiver or a t:slim pump. Those are fine to exist.  If you have another phone with xDrip controlling the transmitter, you need to [disable collection](./Stop-xDrip.md).  
   
2. Set up xDrip and Android for [Dexcom](./G6-Recommended-Settings.md)).  
   
3. Is there [proper connectivity](./Proper-connectivity.md)?  If not, follow the [troubleshooting](./Connectivity-troubleshoot.md) steps.  
   
4. Be patient.  It may take up to 10-15 minutes to connect and show readings.  If you have [proper connectivity](./Proper-connectivity.md) and the receiver or t:slim pump already shows readings, but xDrip does not, you can start sensor in xDrip as well.  This is not related to G7 or One+ as xDrip will start a session for those automatically.
As long as you have used the correct calibration code (for G6 or Dexcom One) when you originally started the session, it does not matter what code you use now.  You might use the same as well.  But, if you don't remember, youc an use any.  
    
5. If you are using a G6, the calibration code on the G5/G6 status page may be incorrect or missing.  This is not a problem.  It is the transmitter that needs the correct code, not xDrip.  You can ignore the incorrect code in xDrip.
