## Session in progress

If you have a Dexcom session running already that was started using another phone or another app or a medical device, and you like to access and control it using xDrip, you can do that easily. You don’t need to start a new or the existing sensor for that.    
<br/>  
  
- If another mobile device or app is currently controlling the transmitter, you will need to either disable it or be outside its range. This does not include the Dexcom receiver or a t:slim pump; these can remain active. If you have another phone with xDrip controlling the device, you need to [disable its collection](./Stop-xDrip.md).  
  
- Set up xDrip and Android for [Dexcom](./G6-Recommended-Settings.md)).  
  
- Ensure [proper connectivity](./Proper-connectivity.md). If not, follow the [troubleshooting steps](./Connectivity-troubleshoot.md).  
  
- Be patient. It may take up to 10-15 minutes to connect and display readings. If you have proper connectivity and the receiver or t:slim pump already shows readings, but xDrip does not, you can start the sensor in xDrip as well. This is not related to G7 or One+, as xDrip will start a session for these automatically. As long as you used the correct calibration code (for G6 or Dexcom One) when you originally started the session, it does not matter what code you use now. You can use the same code or any other. If you don’t remember the code, you can use any.  This is not the case if you are really starting a new sensor though, in which case you will need to use the correct calibration code.  
  
- If you are using a G6, the calibration code on the G5/G6 status page may be incorrect in this case or missing. This is not a problem. It is the transmitter that needs the correct code, not xDrip. You can ignore the incorrect code displayed in xDrip.
