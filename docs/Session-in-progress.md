## Session in progress  
  
If you have a G5 or G6 running already that was started using another phone or another app or another device, and you like to access, and control, it using xDrip, you can do that easily.  You don't need to start a new or the existing sensor for that.  

1. If there is another mobile or app that is currently controlling the transmitter, you either need to disable it or be outside its range.  
2. Set up xDrip and Android for your transmitter ([G5](./G5-Recommended-Settings.md) or [G6](./G6-Recommended-Settings.md)).  
3. Is there [proper connectivity](./Proper-connectivity.md)?  If not, follow the [troubleshooting](./Troubleshoot.md) steps.  
4. Be patient.  It may take up to 20-30 minutes to connect and show readings.  
5. The sensor start time will be correct on the G5/G6 status page.  However, the sensor start time, on the classic status page, may not be correct.  You can ignore it.  
6. If you are using a G6, the calibration code on the G5/G6 status page may be incorrect or missing.  This is not a problem.  It is the transmitter that needs the correct code, not xDrip.  You can ignore the code.
