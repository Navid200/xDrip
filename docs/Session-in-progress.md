## Session in progress

If you have a Dexcom session already running that was started using another phone, app, or medical device, and you want to access and control it using xDrip, you can do so easily. You donâ€™t need to start a new session or reinitialize the existing sensor.     
<br/>  
  
- If another mobile device or app is currently controlling the transmitter, you will need to either disable it or move outside its range. This does not apply to the Dexcom receiver or a t:slim pump; these devices can remain active. If you have another phone with xDrip controlling the device, you will need to [disable its collection](./Stop-xDrip.md).  
  
- Set up [xDrip and Android for Dexcom](./G6-Recommended-Settings.md).  
  
- Ensure [proper connectivity](./Proper-connectivity.md). If you experience issues, follow the [troubleshooting steps](./Connectivity-troubleshoot.md).  
  
- Be patient; it may take up to 10-15 minutes to connect and display readings. If you have proper connectivity and the receiver or t:slim pump shows readings but xDrip does not, you can start a session in xDrip as well. This does not apply to G7 or One+ models, as xDrip will start a session for these automatically. As long as you used the correct calibration code (for G6 or Dexcom One) when you originally started the session, it does not matter what code you use now. You can use the same code or any other. However, if you are starting a new sensor, you will need to use the correct calibration code.  
  
- If you are using a G6, the calibration code on the Dex status page may be incorrect or missing. This is not a problem. It is the transmitter that needs the correct code, not xDrip. You can ignore any incorrect code displayed in xDrip.
