## Preemptive Restart  

When you use [native mode](./Native-Algorithm.md), the sensor will stop after 10 days (7 days for G5).  To avoid that, you will need to use preemptive restart, which will automatically restart the sensor before it stops.  
All G5 transmitters can use preemptive restart.  
Only G6 transmitters whose firmware version is 1.6.5.25 or prior to that can use preemptive restart.  That is all 80XXXX transmitters and some of 81XXXX transmitters.
