We provide xDrip in case you find it beneficial, but we cannot offer any warranties. You assume responsibility for any outcomes.  
  
Unlike some other apps, you can change the version of xDrip on your phone by installing a new version over your current one—there’s no need to uninstall the old version first.  

There is no automatic update feature, but you can manually check for updates within the app.  You can also choose to be notified when there is an update.
