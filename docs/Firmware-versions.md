## Firmware Versions  
  
You can find the first xDrip release that recognizes a new transmitter firmware in the following table.  
To install, download, and install, the file ending in .apk.  No need to uninstall first.  

The table is currently empty because there has been no new firmware released since the latest stable xDrip release.  
Please don't use an xDrip release older than the current stable release (October 4, 2021) except for testing purposes.
