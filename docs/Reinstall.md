Why do you think you need to reinstall xDrip?  
If you uninstall xDrip, you will lose your history and settings.  
There are apps that don't allow undoing an update.  If you update them and you are not happy, in order to go back, you will need to uninstall them first.  
xDrip does not have that limitation.  You can install an older version of xDrip over a newer version with no problem.  No need to uninstall first.  
  
Uninstalling xDrip should be a last resort.  
So, please don't uninstall unless you absolutely need to.  If you do, create a [backup of the database](./Backup-Database.md) before uninstall.  
  
Right after reinstall, [restore the database](./Restore-Database.md).  
Don't set up your collector before restoring the database.  Restoring the database will overwrite all readings.  There is no way to restore a database while maintaining the previous readings unless they are all included in the database being restored.
