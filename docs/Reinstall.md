## Reinstall  

Why do you think you need to reinstall xDrip?  
If you uninstall xDrip, you will lose your history and settings.  
There are apps that don't allow undoing an update.  If you update them and you are not happy, in order to go back, you will need to uninstall them first.  
xDrip does not have that limitation.  You can install an older version of xDrip over a newer version with no problem.  No need to uninstall first.  

Uninstalling xDrip should be a last resort.  
So, please don't uninstall unless you absolutely need to.  If you do, create a [backup of the database](./docs/Backup-Database.md) before uninstall.  

Right after reinstall, [restore the database](./docs/Restore-Database.md).  
Don't set up your collector before restoring the database.  If you do, restoring database after will overwrite all the new readings.
