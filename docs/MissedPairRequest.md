## How to trigger a pair request  
  
Tap on Setting &#8722;> Dexcom Transmitter ID.  
  
Make a record of the code.  Either write it down or take a snapshot.  
Change the last character to something else and apply.  
Then, change the last character back to the original correct value and apply.  
Now, go to the system status page.  

You will see "Hunting Transmitter" in red on that page.  
In up to 5 minutes, you should receive a pair request.  Be sure to approve it.
