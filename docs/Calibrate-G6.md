## Calibrate G6  
  
See [Calibration](./Calibration.md) for details about what calibration is and when and why you should calibrate.  

You should not over-calibrate G6.  Even the manufacturer tells you [that](https://www.dexcom.com/faqs/is-my-dexcom-sensor-accurate).  

You should use an xDrip release not older than the current stable release.  You can see how to update [here](./Updates.md).  
To calibrate, tap on "Add Calibration" from the top left menu on the main screen.  After starting, or restarting, a sensor, you will have to wait to have at least 3 readings before this option appears.  

You should only calibrate when the trend is flat or at least, very close to flat.  

You should never enter a calibration that would attempt to perform a correction greater than 20% of the current reading.  For example, if the reading is 10.0, you can calibrate to 8.0 even if your blood glucose meter shows 7.0.  
To perform multiple consecutive calibrations to achieve the required, greater, correction, you need to space the consecutive calibrations by at least 25 minutes.  If you want to calibrate a third time, delay the third one even more (45 minutes).  
If you don't follow those recommendations, you may get a confused calibration error.  You will then have to wait hours and hope that the readings may come back.  The problem is that there is no way to know how long you may need to wait.  So, the best course of action is to avoid causing that error.  

Ideally, you will not need to calibrate a G6.  If you are new to G6, you should give it (factory calibration) a chance.
