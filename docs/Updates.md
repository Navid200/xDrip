**<span style="color:red">Do not uninstall</span>**  
If you uninstall, you will lose all your old readings.  Fortunately, you don't need to uninstall xDrip to install an update, which is the only way to update.  You can install a different version over your existing installation.  
  
You cannot install a release from one repository over an installation of xDrip from a different repository.  
Therefore, if you are using xDrip from a repository other than the [main repository](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip), and you want to come back, you will need to uninstall first.  [Backup the database](./Backup.md) before uninstall so that you can restore the old readings and settings after you switch.

#### **Do I need to update?**  
If everything is working fine, you don't have to update.  
But, it's best to at least update to the current stable release.

#### **How to only update in your chosen channel**  
From the 3-dot menu button at the top right corner of the main screen, tap on `Check for updated version`.

If there has been an update in your update channel, it will be downloaded into your Download folder, and you can install it by tapping on it.  

To update to a release that is not in your update channel, please continue to read.

#### **How to update regardless of your chosen channel**  
You can install any release without changing your update channel.  
Find the release you want looking at the [release notes](./ReleaseNotes.md).  Then, tap on the corresponding link, [download](./Download-xDrip.md), and [install](./Install.md).  Later on, when you tap on check for updates, you will only get an update when there is an update in your chosen update channel.  
<br/>

#### **Update channels**  
You can choose one of four update channels, Nightly (pre-release), Alpha, Beta and Stable.  
  
You will be informed only when there is an update in your selected channel when you check for updates or if you enable `Automatic update check`.  
  
| Channel | Description | Average Frequency |  
|:--------------:|:-----------: | :--------: |   
| Nightly        | Most up-to-date but least tested | Twice a month |  
| Alpha          | Earlier release than beta | Twice a year |  
| Beta / Stable  | Most tested (default) | Twice a year |

#### **Select update channel or automatic check**  
To select an update channel, access [Main Settings](./Settings.md) &#8722;> `xDrip+ Update Settings`.  
![](./images/auto_update.png)  
You need to choose alpha in order for the nightly option to become visible.  After selecting the alpha channel, return to the main screen.  Then, go back to the Update Settings page and you will see the Nightly as an option now.  
To use the auto update check, enable Automatic update check.  
Now, you will be notified when there is a new release in your selected channel.
