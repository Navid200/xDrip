**<span style="color:red">Do not uninstall</span>**  
You don't need to uninstall xDrip to install another version.  You can install a different version over your existing installation.  
If you uninstall, you will lose all your old readings.  
<br/>

#### **Do I need to update?**  
If everything is working fine, you don't have to update.  
But, if you experience problems, it's best to at least update to the current stable release.  
<br/>

#### **How to update**  
From the 3-dot menu button at the top right corner of the main screen, tap on `Check for updated version`.

If there has been an update, in the update channel you are using, more up-to-date than the version you are currently using, it will be downloaded, into your Download folder, and you can install it by tapping on it.

#### **Can I undo an update?**  
You can install an older version of xDrip over the version you currently have installed.  Therefore, you can undo an update by installing the version you had previously.  
In rare occasions, a Nightly release may malfunction.  In that case, you can undo your update until a new version is released.  If you detect a problem, please [report](./Contact.md) it.  
<br/>

#### **Update channels**  
You can choose one of four update channels, Nightly (pre-release), Alpha, Beta and Stable.  
  
A pre-release is a release that has only been tested by the developers.  We call it a Nightly release.  
On average, there is a Nightly release once a week.  All new releases are released as a Nightly.  
  
An alpha release has been tested by a few users in the Nightly channel for a while after having been tested by developers.  Then, it has been tagged as an alpha.  The content does not change.  In other words, an alpha is a Nightly before it becomes an alpha.  
  
A beta release, which is the stable release for xDrip, has been tested in the alpha channel by some users as well as in the Nightly channel by a few users as well as by the developers.  Then, it is tagged as a beta.  A beta (stable) release is a Nightly first before it becomes an alpha or a beta.  There is about one stable release once every 6 months.  

When you choose an update channel, you will be informed only when there is an update in that channel when you check for updates or if you enable `Automatic update check`.  
  
| Channel | Description |  
|:--------------:|:-----------: |  
| Nightly        | Most up-to-date but least tested |  
| Alpha          | Less up-to-date / more tested than Nightly |  
| Beta / Stable  | Most tested (default) |

#### **Select update channel or automatic check**  
To select an update channel, access [Main Settings](./Settings.md) &#8722;> `xDrip+ Update Settings`.  
![](./images/auto_update.png)  
You need to choose alpha in order for the nightly option to become visible.  
To use the auto update check, enable Automatic update check.  
You may need to restart.  Now, you will be notified when there is a new release in your selected channel.  
<br/>

#### **What if I want a feature that has just been released in a Nightly?**  
You have two options.  
  
1- You can switch to the Nightly channel.  Then, tap on check for updates to get the latest Nightly release.  Later on, every time you check for updates, you will be checking the Nightly channel.  
  
2- You can install the latest Nightly release without changing your update channel.  
Find the release you want looking at the [release notes](./ReleaseNotes.md).  Then, tap on the corresponding link, [download](./Download-xDrip.md), and [install](./Install.md).  Now, you will have the latest Nightly installed.  Later on, when you tap on check for updates, you will only get an update when there is an update in your chosen update channel.
