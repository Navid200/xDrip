After finding the release that you want, download the file with .apk at the end and no "variant" in the title, under "Assets" and install over.  No need to uninstall first.  Installing over your existing xDrip will maintain the settings and readings history.  
To confirm that the update succeeded, go to classic status page and check the first line, which shows the date of the release you have installed.  

To select which update channel you use, go to Settings &#8722;> xDrip+ Update Settings.

You need to choose alpha in order for the nightly option to become visible.  
To use the auto update check, enable Automatic update check.  
You may need to restart.  Now, you will be notified when there is a new release in your selected channel. **Currently, this capability is not working for the Beta and Stable channels.**   
  
Even if you don't want to use the automatic update check feature, you should choose the update channel you prefer.  
When you tap on the top right menu button on the main screen and tap on "Check for updated version", xDrip checks your selected channel only. **Currently, this does not work for the Beta and Stable channels.**
