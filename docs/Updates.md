**<span style="color:red">Do not uninstall</span>**  
You don't need to uninstall xDrip to install another version.  You can install a different version over your existing installation.  
If you uninstall, you will lose all your old readings.

#### **Do I need to update?**  
If eveyrthing is working fine, you don't have to update.  
But, if you experience problems, it's best to at least update to the current stable release.  
<br/>

#### **How to update?**  
From the 3-dot menu button at the top right corner of the main screen, tap on `Check for updated version`.  
If there has been an update, in the update channel you are using, more up-to-date than the version you are currently using, it will be downloaded and you will have the option to install it.

#### **Can I undo an update?**  
You can install an older version of xDrip over the version you currently have installed.  
Therefore, you can undo an update by installing the same version you had installed before you updated to undo it.

#### **Update channels**  
An update could cause unintended behavior.  It is practically impossible to fully test a piece of software.  Some bugs will be found by users after release.  That's why releases are made in stages.  
A pre-release is a release that has only been tested by the developers.  We call it a Nightly release.  
On average, there is a Nightly release once a week.  
  
An alpha release has been tested by a few users in the Nightly channel for a while after having been tested by developers.  
  
A beta release, which is the stable release for xDrip, has been tested in the alpha channel by some users as well as in the Nightly channel by a few users as well as by the developers.  There is about one stable release once every 6 months.  
  
| Channel | Description |  
|:--------------:|:-----------:|  
| Nightly        | Most up-to-date but least tested |  
| Alpha          | Less up-to-date but more tested than Nightly |  
| Beta / Stable  | Less up-to-date but more tested than Alpha |

You need to choose alpha in order for the nightly option to become visible.  
To use the auto update check, enable Automatic update check.  
You may need to restart.  Now, you will be notified when there is a new release in your selected channel.
