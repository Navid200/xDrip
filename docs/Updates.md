**<span style="color:red">Do not uninstall</span>**  
You don't need to uninstall xDrip to install another version.  You can install a different version over your existing installation.  
If you uninstall, you will lose all your old readings.  
<br/>

#### **Do I need to update?**  
If everything is working fine, you don't have to update.  
But, if you experience problems, it's best to at least update to the current stable release.  
<br/>

#### **How to update**  
From the 3-dot menu button at the top right corner of the main screen, tap on `Check for updated version`.  
If there has been an update, in the update channel you are using, more up-to-date than the version you are currently using, it will be downloaded and you will have the option to install it.    
<br/>

#### **Can I undo an update?**  
You can install an older version of xDrip over the version you currently have installed.  Therefore, you can undo an update by installing the version you had previously.  
In rare occasions, a Nightly release may malfunction.  In that case, you can undo your update until a new version is released.  If you detect a problem, please [report](./Contact.md) it.  
<br/>

#### **Update channels**  
Releases are made in stages.  
  
A pre-release is a release that has only been tested by the developers.  We call it a Nightly release.  
On average, there is a Nightly release once a week.  
  
An alpha release has been tested by a few users in the Nightly channel for a while after having been tested by developers.  
  
A beta release, which is the stable release for xDrip, has been tested in the alpha channel by some users as well as in the Nightly channel by a few users as well as by the developers.  There is about one stable release once every 6 months.  

When you choose an update channel, you will be informed only when there is an update in that channel when you check for updates or if you enable `Automatic update check`.  
  
| Channel | Description |  
|:--------------:|:-----------:|  
| Nightly        | Most up-to-date but least tested |  
| Alpha          | Less up-to-date but more tested than Nightly |  
| Beta / Stable  | Less up-to-date but more tested than Alpha |

You need to choose alpha in order for the nightly option to become visible.  
To use the auto update check, enable Automatic update check.  
You may need to restart.  Now, you will be notified when there is a new release in your selected channel.
