## How strong is the transmitter signal?

If the transmitter is not transmitting, you will not be able to use it, regardless of how you set up xDrip. Sometimes, it may be necessary to verify that the transmitter is functioning. You can use a Bluetooth scanner for this purpose. It’s best to use a scanner that scans continuously rather than one that scans for only a minute or so and then stops. At the time of writing this page, the following app meets that requirement:  
[BLE Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.macdom.ble.blescanner)  

Install the app on any Android phone. It doesn’t need to be the same phone that has xDrip installed. Be cautious with the on-screen ads.  
  
Run the app and grant permission when requested. Ensure the transmitter is in the same room as the scanner.  
  
The app will start scanning for available Bluetooth devices. It will create a list of devices. Scroll through the list to see all the detected devices.  
  
For a G6 or Dexcom One, look for a device named Dexcom\*\*, where \*\* are the last two characters of the transmitter’s serial number.  
  
For a G7 or One+, look for a device named DXCM\*\* or DX02\*\*.  The last two characters are random and unrelated to the pairing code.  
  
Beside the device name, you will see a negative number. Write this number down.  
You may need to wait up to 5 minutes to see the listing. If the listing is not clear and bold, you will need to wait again for the next reading cycle. Write down the value when it appears in bold.

If the listing never shows up, the transmitter is not transmitting.  
  
If you see the listing, report it, as well as the value beside it, to the person who asked you for the scan.  
If you see the listing, report the value beside it to the person who requested the scan.  
  
You can uninstall the scanner app after you are finished.
