## Why nothing happens when I check for updates?

xDrip only checks for updates in the update channel you have chosen.  
If nothing happens when you check for updates, it means there are no releases in the update channel you have chosen more recent than the release you have currently installed.  
See [Update xDrip](./Updates.md) for details.
