## Google Cloud Nightscout Cost Table
[Google Cloud Nightscout](./GoogleCloud) >> Cost Table  
  
You can get a categorized list of costs from Google Cloud even before your free trial period ends.  You must have [created a Google Project and activated billing](./NS_GCProject.md) for this to work.  
  
Go to [Billing](./Billing.md).  
  
Click on "Cost table" in the left pane.  Click on "Column display options".

Click on OK.  
  
Choose an invoice.  Keep in mind that an invoice will only become complete on the third day of the month.  So, the invoice for December, will not yet be valid on January 2.
