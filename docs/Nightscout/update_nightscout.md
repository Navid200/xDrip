## Update Nightscout
[xDrip](../../README.md) >> [Features](../Features_page.md) >> [Nightscout](../Nightscout_page.md) >> [Google Cloud](./GoogleCloud.md) >> Update Nightscout  
  
To see what version of Nightscout you currently have, open Nightscout in a browser, click on the (hamburger) menu button, and scroll down to the "About" section, where you can see the Nightscout version.      
You need to have completed the Nightscout [installation](./NS_Install.md) steps before attempting to update.  
  
Look at the [Nightscout on Google Cloud](./GoogleCloud.md) web site.  Look at the "Installation" heading.  What follows, in parentheses, is the version of Nightscout a fresh installation will provide.  You can easily update to that version as explained below.  
  
To proceed, select "Update scripts" from the [menu](./Menu.md) and enter.  
Follow the instructions and open a new terminal or click on retry.  
In the new window, from the menu, select "Installation phase 1" and enter.  
After completion, reboot the server.  Nightscout is now updated.  
  
When a new version of Nightscout is released, we will need to install it on Google Cloud to verify that the installation succeeds.  We then need to test it to verify that it is functional in our setup.  We may need to change the packages we install in Linux in order to be able to install the new release.  
Only after everything is tested, will we release an updated installation routine.  At that point, the version noted on the Nightscout on Google Cloud page will be updated to reflect the new release, and you will be able to use the method mentioned above to update.  
  
Therefore, there will be times (right after a new Nightscout version is released) when you will not be able to use the method mentioned above to update.  
In that case, the best course of action is to be patient.
