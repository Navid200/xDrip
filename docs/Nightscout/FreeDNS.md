Follow these instructions in order to use FreeDNS, which you will need in order to set up Nightscout on Google Cloud.  
  
**Go to FreeDNS site:** [https://freedns.afraid.org/](https://freedns.afraid.org/)  
**Click on Sign up Free, and sign up.**  Make sure to choose a user ID excluding capital letters.  
If you include capital letters in your user ID, FreeDNS will convert it all to lowercase.  
You will be asked to enter your user ID and password later on as a part of the Nightscout installation.  **Please remember your password.**  
  
**Send activation email.**

**Click on Main Menu to log in.**  
After logging in, you can see your user ID at the top right corner.

You will need your user ID and password later to use the FreeDNS Setup utility.  **Please remember your user ID.**  
  
**Go to [Subdomains](https://freedns.afraid.org/subdomain/).**  
**Add.**  
**Enter a subdomain name.**  Pick a public domain.  Under the image, enter text (capital) to capture the image you see.  You can change the image if it's not clear.  
**Save.**
