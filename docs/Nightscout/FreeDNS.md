You will need your user ID and password later to use the FreeDNS Setup utility.  
  
Go to [Subdomains](https://freedns.afraid.org/subdomain/).  
Add.  
Enter a subdomain name.  Pick a public domain.  Under the image, enter text (capital) to capture the image you see.  You can change the image if it's not clear.  
Save.

Now, if you go to [Subdomains](https://freedns.afraid.org/subdomain/), you will see your new subdomain:

That is what you will be using to access your Nightscout in a web browser.
  
Select "FreeDNS Setup" from the main menu.  
You will be asked for the hostname and direct URL.  Enter the values you have recorded from the previous steps.  
When the process completes, Nightscout will be running, and accessible through your Free DNS hostname.
