Follow these instructions in order to use FreeDNS, which you will need in order to set up Nightscout on Google Cloud.  
  
Go to FreeDNS site: [https://freedns.afraid.org/](https://freedns.afraid.org/)  
Click on Sign up Free, and sign up.  
Send activation email.

Open email and activate your account.  
  
Click on Main Menu to log in.  
After logging in, you can see your user ID at the top right corner.

You will need your user ID and password later to use the FreeDNS Setup utility.  
  
Go to [Subdomains](https://freedns.afraid.org/subdomain/).  
Add.  
Enter a subdomain name (<span style="color:red">all lowercase</span>).  You can create a subdomain that has capital letters in it.  This will cause problems later.  Therefore, please make sure you use lowercase only.  Pick a public domain.  Under the image, enter text (capital) to capture the image you see.  You can change the image if it's not clear.  
Save.

Now, if you go to [Subdomains](https://freedns.afraid.org/subdomain/), you will see your new subdomain:

That is what you will be using to access your Nightscout in a web browser.
