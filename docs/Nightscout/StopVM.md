## Stop and start virtual machine  
[Google Cloud Nightscout](./GoogleCloud.md) >> Stop and start virtual machine  
  
You may need to stop a virtual machine.  You cannot meet the free tier requirements if you have more than one virtual machine running.  If you stop a virtual machine you are running Nightscout on, its IP address will change when you start it again.  
  
After restarting the virtual machine, you need to be patient for less than a minute for the new ip address to be mapped to your hostname.  
So, you may not be able to bring up Nightscout in a browser or follow with your follower right away.  
  
To stop a virtual machine, go to the [compute engine](./ComputeEngine.md).  

Choose “Stop” from the 3-dot menu.
