Do you get this error when you attempt to access your Nightscout in a browser?

This could have been caused by having run bootstrap and not having followed by executing Install Nightscout phase 1.  
Please run Install Nightscout phase 1 from the Google Cloud setup submenu.  Then, please restart the server from the main menu.  
  
After restast, if the problem persists, please [contact us](../Contact.md).
