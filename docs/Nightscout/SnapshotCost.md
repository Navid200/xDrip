## Google Cloud Storage PD Snapshot  
[Google Cloud Nightscout](./GoogleCloud.md) >> Why have I been charged for Storage PD Snapshot?  
  
[Snapshots](./Snapshots.md) are not free.  
You can see the costs [here](https://cloud.google.com/compute/pricing-announce#storage_pd_snapshot_skus).  

Delete your snapshot as soon as you don't need it any longer to minimize cost.  
The only way to establish why you have been charged is to create a [cost table](./CostTable.md).
