Menus are used so that you can accomplish everything you need without having to deal with Linux command entry.  The following shows one of the menus.

There are two different areas on the menu.  One is at the top containing the different paramerts that can be entered identified with an orange enclosing marker.  
The other is at the bottom containing "Submit" and "Cencel" in this case identified by a green enclosing marker.  
  
When you first see a menu, the cursor is in the first area at the top.  You can move between the User ID and Password using the up and down arrow keys.  But, you cannot move the cursor to submit or cancel by pressing the up or down arrow keys.  
In order to move the cursor to the area at the bottom, you need to press the TAB key.  After you do that, you can use the left and right arrow keys to move between "Submit" and "Cancel".  
To go back to the area at the top and add or edit the parameters, you can use the TAB key again.
