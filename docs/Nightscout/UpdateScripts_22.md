## Edit Variables in a browser does not work!
[xDrip](../../README.md) >> [Features](../Features_page) >> [Nightscout](../Nightscout_page) >> [Nightscout on Google Cloud](./GoogleCloud) >> Update variables in a browser  
  
If choosing "Edit variables in a browser" from the menu brings up a dialog directing you to press enter to proceed, but doing that, takes you back to the main menu, you will need to update scripts.  
  
Please use "Update scripts" from the main menu.  Then, please close the window when directed and open a new one.  
Now, edit variables in a browser should work fine.
