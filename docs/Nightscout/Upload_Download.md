Click on “Choose Files”.  Select the file you want to upload and click on “Upload Files”.  
You will be able to see the upload progress.  If SSH crashes during the upload, it will fail and you will need to repeat.  
After the upload completes, you will be able to find the file in your home directory on the virtual machine.
