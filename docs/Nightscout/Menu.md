## Menu
[xDrip](../../README.md) >> [Features](../Features_page.md) >> [Nightscout](../Nightscout_page.md) >> [Google Cloud](./GoogleCloud.md) >> Menu  
  
When you open a terminal, the main menu will automatically come up.

If no menu comes up when you open a terminal, you need to [update](./NS_SyncExecutables.md) your installation files.  
  
We use SSH on Google Cloud to access the virtual machine.  It is not possible to use the mouse to click on the options on the menu.  
  
To use the menu, you can use the arrow keys to move the cursor.  The tab button moves the cursor to the next field.  
For example, if you are filling a form (customize Nightscout), you use the arrow keys to move to different form items.  After you have filled all the values, you can press tab to move the cursor to OK at the bottom to submit the form.  
  
If you are selecting a file on a menu (MongoDB restore), move the cursor over the file name.  Then, press the spacebar to select the file.  
  
If you need to use the shell (terminal), select "Exit to shell".  
To return to the menu after, you can open a new terminal, or enter menu in the terminal.
