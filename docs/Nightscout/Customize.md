## Customize Nightscout

You need to have completed the Nightscout [installation](./NS_Install.md) steps before using this utility.  
You can use it to install from a GitHub fork.  There is no guarantee that this will be successful.  If the fork you install from has errors, you will not have a working system.  
What could be even worse is if you end up with a working system that provides erroneous information.  Please proceed at your own risk.  
  
**<span style="color:red">During the process, which takes about 25 minutes, your Nightscout will not be operational.</span>**  If you need Nightscout for a loop, please create an alternative session and switch to it while updating the other.  
  
To proceed, select "Customize Nightscout" from the [menu](./Menu.md) and enter.  
In a minute, the following dialog will show.

Enter the user ID, repository name and branch name to install from.  You can use the arrow keys to move the cursor to different fields.
Then, use tab to move the cursor to Submit or cancel.  
After submitting, Nightscout will be installed from the fork you have selected.  
The installation will take about 25 minutes.  
  
If you proceed, you will see progress in the terminal for a while.  Then, you will see no change in the terminal for 20 minutes.  You need to be patient.  
  
After installation is complete, the virtual machine will reboot.  Your terminal will show an error.  This is expected.  Wait a minute and Nightscout will come up.  You can close the terminal now.
