**<span style="color:red">Do NOT</span>** delete the virtual machine!
Your Nightscout database (all your readings history) is stored on the virtual machine disk.  If you delete the virtual machine, you will lose the database.  
Only delete the machine if you have backed up the database, or if you are certain you don't need the contents.  Follow [backup](./DatabaseBackup.md) instructions to create a backup of your database.
