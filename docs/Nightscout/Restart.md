## Restart Nightscout
[Google Cloud Nightscout](./GoogleCloud.md) >> Restart Nightscout   
  
To restart Nightscout, you can reboot the virtual machine.  
To do that, open a [terminal](./Terminal).  From the [menu](./Menu.md), select "Reboot server" and enter.  
  
The terminal will then show a [connection error](./ConnectionFailed.md) because it will be disconnected from the machine since it is rebooting.  
Wait a minute, and Nightscout will be back up and running again.

#### **Note**  
You run Nightscout on a Google Cloud virtual machine that you created as a part of the original installation.  If you look under installation on the Google Cloud Nightscout [main page](./GoogleCloud.md), you will see the "Virtual Machine" heading link you must have followed during installation.  
  
Therefore, restarting the virtual machine will restart the server.
