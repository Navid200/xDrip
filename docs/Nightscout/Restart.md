## Restart Nightscout
[xDrip](../../README.md) >> [Features](../Features_page.md) >> [Nighsctout](../Nightscout_page.md) >> [Google Cloud](./GoogleCloud.md) >> Restart Nightscout  
  
To restart Nightscout, you can reboot the virtual machine.  
To do that, open a [terminal](./Terminal).  From the [menu](./Menu.md), select "Reboot server" and enter.  
  
The terminal will then show a [connection error](./ConnectionFailed.md) because it will be disconnected from the machine since it is rebooting.  
Wait a minute, and Nightscout will be back up and running again.
