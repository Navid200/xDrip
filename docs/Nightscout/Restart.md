To restart Nightscout, you can reboot the virtual machine.  
To do that, open a [terminal](./Terminal).  In the terminal, enter:  
sudo reboot  
The terminal will then show an error because it will be disconnected from the machine since it is rebooting.  
Wait a minute, and Nightscout will be back up and running again.
