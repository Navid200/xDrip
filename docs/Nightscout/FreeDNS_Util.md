Open a [terminal](./Terminal.md) on the virtual machine.  
Select "FreeDNS Setup" from the main menu.  
If you don't see it on the main menu, select Update scripts and enter.  After it completes, close the window and open a new one.  Now, you will have FreeDNS Setup on the menu.  
  
You will be asked for your user ID and password.  Enter those.  
After you have provided what the script needs, it will perform the necessary edits to enable FreeDNS.  Please be patient allowing the script to complete.  It may take up to 10 minutes.  

Only if you see a disconnect message, just close the window, open a new one and rerun the utility.  Otherwise, please allow the script to continue to run until it completes even if you see errors on screen even in red.  

When the process completes, Nightscout will be running, and accessible through your Free DNS subdomain (hostname).
