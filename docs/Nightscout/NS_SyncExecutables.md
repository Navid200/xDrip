## Update to latest release
[xDrip](../../README.md) >> [Features](../Features_page.md) >> [Nightscout](../Nightscout_page.md) >> [Google Cloud](./GoogleCloud.md) >> Update to latest release  
  
This is how you can update the Nightscout executable files in the root installtion directory.  
If you followed the instructions in the early days to install Nightscout on Google Cloud, you may not have the latest files.  It's a good idea to follow these instructions to update.  
  
Open a [terminal](./Terminal).  
In the terminal, type and enter:  
  
<Mark>cd /srv/nightcout-vps</Mark>  
<Mark>sudo git pull</Mark>  
  
You will see a report of any files that were updated.
