## Update commands & menus
[xDrip](../../README.md) >> [Features](../Features_page.md) >> [Nightscout](../Nightscout_page.md) >> [Google Cloud](./GoogleCloud.md) >> Update to latest release  
  
This is how you can update your virtual machine with the latest menus and commands.    
  
Open a [terminal](./Terminal.md).  
A menu should come up automatically.  From the menu, select "Update scripts".  
If the main [menu](./Menu.md) does not come up automatically when you open a terminal, it means you are running an older release.  In that case, type and enter the following in the terminal to update everyting.  
  
<mark style="background-color: #eFdFef">curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamorham/nightscout-vps/vps-1/bootstrap.sh | bash</Mark>  
  
The terminal will show a disconnect.  Wait 30 seconds and then, click on retry.  The terminal will open and you should see the updated menu automatically coming up on screen.
