This is how you can update the Nightscout executable files in the root installtion directory.  
If you followed the instructions in the early days to install Nightscout on Google Cloud, you may not have the latest files.  It's a good idea to follow these instructions to update.  
  
Open a [terminal](./Terminal).  
In the terminal, type and enter:  
cd /srv/nightcout-vps  
sudo git pull   
  
You will see a report of any files that were updated.
