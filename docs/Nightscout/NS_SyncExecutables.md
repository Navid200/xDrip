## Update command files to latest release  
[xDrip](../../README.md) >> [Features](../Features_page.md) >> [Nightscout](../Nightscout_page.md) >> [Google Cloud](./GoogleCloud.md) >> Update to latest release  
  
This is how you can update your virtual machine with the latest menus and commands.  
If you followed the instructions in the early days to install Nightscout on Google Cloud, you may not have the latest files.  It's a good idea to follow these instructions to update.  
  
Open a [terminal](./Terminal.md).  
A menu should come up automatically.  From the menu, select "Update scripts".  
If the main menu does not come up automatically when you open a terminal, type and enter the following.  
  
<Mark>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamorham/nightscout-vps/vps-1/bootstrap.sh | bash</Mark>  
  
The terminal will show a disconnect.  Wait 30 seconds and then, click on retry.  The terminal will open and you should see the updated menu automatically coming up on screen.
