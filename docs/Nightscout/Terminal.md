If you have logged out, go to [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) and sign in using your Google account.

If you have completed installation already, a menu will come up in the terminal.

If you need to use the terminal (shell), you can close the menu (exit to shell).  
  
If instead, you get a connectivity error message shown in the following image, click on "Retry without Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy".

When you are done using the terminal, you can click on X at the top right corner to close it.
