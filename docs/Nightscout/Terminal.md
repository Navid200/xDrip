## Virtual machine terminal
[Google Cloud Nightscout](./GoogleCloud.md) >> Terminal  
  
You can access a Linux terminal on your virtual machine if you have completed the setup of your [virtual machine](./VirtualMachine.md).  
  
If you have logged out, go to [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) and sign in using your Google account.  
Click on Console.

If your browser asks permission to open a window, grant it.  If your browser is set to block pop-ups, this will not work.  You will need to change your browser's settings to allow pop-ups from the Google Cloud page.  

If you see the following, please authorize.

Be patient as it may take a few seconds for the terminal to come up.

If you have completed installation already, a menu will come up in the terminal.

If you need to use the terminal (shell), you can close the menu (exit to shell).  
  
If instead, you get a connectivity error message shown in the following image, click on "Retry without Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy".

When you are done using the terminal, you can click on X at the top right corner to close it.
