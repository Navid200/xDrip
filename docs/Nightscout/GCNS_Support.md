### Request for Help  
If you need help installing or using Google Cloud Nightscout, please post in [discussions](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/discussions).  
include the following in the first post.  
- What is (or will be) uploading to Nightscout?
- A screenshot of the [status page](./Status.md) if you have completed the installation.  

Include a short description of what is wrong. For example "No readings", or "Sensor Stopped".  
Also, state if there is something that has changed. For example, is this a new phone, did you recently receive an Android patch, if the problem only occurs with a particular release of xDrip, if you are new to xDrip, or if a new sensor started the issue.  

**<span style="color:red">Please don't open an issue.</span>**  
Please allow us to manage the issues.  There used to be too many issues opened up by users.  Many could just be addressed by using xDrip differently.  In the meantime, there were always too many open issues and there was no way for the developers to know which ones were real.  
Please help us manage the issues more efficiently by opening a [discussion](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/discussions) instead of an issue.  If it turns out to be an issue, we will convert the discussion into an issue.  
  
  
#### What you shouldn't include  
Your hostname or API_SECRET, your full name, address, phone number, or email address.  We don't need any of those in order to help you.  
  
  
### Suggestions 
To reach out to developers, post in the [discussions](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/discussions).  
xDrip is constantly being improved and your suggestions are welcome.  But, please note that there is a price to pay for every new feature.  xDrip needs to be maintained and documented.  That means xDrip bugs need to be fixed.  The more features there are, the more complicated the bugs will become.  
Please post your suggestions.  But, please be patient.  
  
  
### Feedback  
If you find an item in the documentation that is not explained clearly, or if you like a subject to be added, or if you have found errors, please post in [discussions](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/discussions).  Please include in your post a link to the document to clarify which page you are referring to.
