You can always use a web browser or xDrip to follow and see the readings from your Nightscout site.  
Using tokens for following is the most secure method.  Giving permission to the world to access your site is not.  
Also, giving the world permission to access your site may allow crawlers to access it, which will increase traffic.  In order to keep your Nighsctout project in free tier, you need to minimize traffic.
