## Deprecation Warning
[Google Cloud Nightscout](./GoogleCloud.md) >> Deprecation Warning  
  
While running installation phase 1, you will see a deprecation warning.  
![](./images/DeprecationWarning.png)  
  
This is OK.  Please be patient while the installation completes.  
<br/>  
  
Node 14 has reached end of life and is no longer receiving updates.  
Nightscout is now updated to use Node 16.  
However, Node 16 does not have much life left either.  And it makes the installation mush slower.  The recommended version to use now is actually Node 18.  

We are waiting for Nightscout to be updated to Node 18, at which point, we will also use Node 18.  

Please use this virtual machine only as a host for Nightscout.  Please don't use it for running anything else.  Definitely not related to banking or any other sensitive material.
