Please provide [feedback](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/discussions).  
If you want to use this while still using Heroku, set this up, and add the link to your xDrip Nightscout upload URL, separated by a space from your Heroku link.  Now, xDrip will continue to upload to your Heroku.  But, also upload to your Google Cloud Nightscout.
  
You will need a credit card to set up billing.  However, it will be free if you meet the [requirements](./NS_FreeTier).  
  
To complete installation, you will need to go through the first 5 items on the list below.  If you have followers, you will also need to complete item 6 after.  
It will take a while (about 90 minutes) to complete the entire setup.  
The rest of the items you see on this page are optional items on the menu or issues you may run into and how to address them.  
**Video** clips are included to help with setup.  They have no sound.  To enlarge, click on the square symbol on the right side of the speaker symbol at the bottom of the video frame.
