If you already have a working Nightscout on Heroku, there is no rush to switch to this now yet.  
  
You will need a credit card to set up billing.  The hope is that this will be free and this guide will be updated as soon as we can confirm in the next few weeks.  Regardless, a credit card is required.  
If you have a follower who is in Australia or China, the data traffic from your server to them will not qualify for Free Tier as you can see in Free Tier details below.  
  
It will take a while (about 90 minutes) to complete the entire setup.
