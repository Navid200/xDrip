If you want to use this while still using Heroku, set this up, and add the link to your xDrip Nightscout upload URL, separated by a space from your Heroku link.  Now, xDrip will continue to upload to your Heroku.  But, also upload to your Google Cloud Nightscout.
  
You will need a credit card to set up billing.  
  
It will take a while (about 90 minutes) to complete the entire setup.  
**Video** clips are included to help with setup.  They have no sound.  To enlarge, click on the square symbol on the right side of the speaker symbol at the bottom of the video frame.
