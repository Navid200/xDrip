Nightscout can serve as a repository for all your xDrip readings. This is crucial for creating comprehensive reports for your endocrinologist and for tracking how your glucose control changes over time. Without a repository, your readings are only stored on your phone, posing a risk if you lose or damage your device.    
  
Additionally, Nightscout can be used as a server for sharing data with your followers.  
  
Setting up Nightscout requires some effort and is not something you can complete in just 5 minutes. There are various setup options available, so youâ€™ll need to find and follow the instructions specific to the server you choose.  
  
Alternatively, you can subscribe to a service provider to handle the setup for you.  
  
If you already have Nightscout set up, instructions for configuring xDrip as an uploader (master) can be found [here](./Nightscout-Settings.md). How to use xDrip to follow an existing Nightscout site is explained [here](./Follow/FollowNightscout.md).
