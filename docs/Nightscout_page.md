Heroku will not be free after November 28, 2022.  See [discussion](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/discussions/2299).  
We are looking at alternative approaches.  This page will be updated accordingly.  
  
[Nightscout on Google Cloud](./Nightscout/GoogleCloud)  
  
Nightscout can be a (free) repository of all your xDrip readings.  
Your readings are important because you need them to create a report for your endocrinologist.  
You yourself may like to create reports for different time periods in order to examine how your control has changed over long periods of time.  
Without a repository, all your readings will be on your phone.  What happens if you lose your phone or if your phone is broken?  
  
In addition, you can also use Nightscout as a server for your followers.  
  
To set up Nightscout, you need to do a little bit of work.  There are detail instructions for each server.  
Give yourself some time to complete everything.  It's not something you can do in just 5 minutes.  
  
If you have Nightscout already set up, how to set up xDrip as an uploader (master) is explained [here](./Nightscout-Settings.md).
