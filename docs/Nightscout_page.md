Nightscout can be a repository of all your xDrip readings.  
Your readings are important because you need them to create a report for your endocrinologist.  
You may like to create reports for different time periods in order to examine how your control has changed over long periods of time.  
Without a repository, all your readings will be on your phone.  What happens if you lose your phone or if your phone is broken?  
  
In addition, you can also use Nightscout as a server for your followers.  
  
To set up Nightscout, you need to do a little bit of work.  There are different options.  Find instructions for the server you want to use and follow.  
Give yourself some time to complete everything.  It's not something you can do in just 5 minutes.  

These are instructions and tips for setting up [Google Cloud Nightscout](./Nightscout/GoogleCloud.md).  
  
If you have Nightscout already set up, how to set up xDrip as an uploader (master) is explained [here](./Nightscout-Settings.md).  
How to use xDrip to follow an existing Nightscout site is explained [here](./Follow/FollowNightscout.md).
