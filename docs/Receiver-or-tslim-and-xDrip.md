## xDrip coexists with Dexcom receiver or t:slim pump  
[xDrip](../README.md) >> [Features](./Features_page.md) >> [xDrip & Dexcom](./Dexcom_page.md) >> xDrip and G6 Receiver  
  
If you have a t:slim pump, you can start your sensors on the pump, not on xDrip.  
There is no need to start the same sensor also on xDrip.  
In case of G6 or Dexcom One, there is no need to enter the calibration code in xDrip as well.  The only item that needs the G6 or Dex1 calibration code is the transmitter.  
After the warm-up period has completed, xDrip will pick up the session.  If it doesn't, tap on restart collector on the classic status page.    
  
Don't stop sensor on xDrip thinking that it would only stop xDrip.  It will stop the sensor session on the transmitter.    
  
If you have a Dexcom receiver and like to use it alongside xDrip, you can.  But, again, don't send redundant commands to the transmitter. 
If you absolutely have to use the Dexcom receiver, again, start the sensor on the receiver.  Let xDrip pick up the session after warm-up.    
  
You cannot use both a t:slim pump and the Dexcom receiver as they use the same transmitter slot.  It's for the same reason you cannot use both xDrip and the Dexcom app to collect from the same transmitter.

\*    You can use xDrip and the Dexcom app if only one is collecting from the same transmitter.  For example, you can use xDrip as a follower of the Dexcom app.
