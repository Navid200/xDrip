## Custom sound/alarm grayed out  
  
On the "Edit Alert" page, if you tap on "Choose file" and select "Custom Sound/Alert" and navigate to an mp3 file on your device, you may see that it is grayed out.  
This is a known bug and there is an open pull request to remove the option:  https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/pull/1827  

To use a custom file, you can use these [instructions](./Custom-Alert-Sound.md).
