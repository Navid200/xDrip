## Disable Collection  
[xDrip](../README.md) >> [Features](./Features_page.md) >> Disable collection  
  
If you want to stop using xDrip without uninstalling it, you can disable collection.  
To do that, go to Settings &#8722;> Hardware Data Source.  
Make a record of the current setting so that you remember in case you want to undo this.  
Scroll all the way down, and tap on "Disable Collection".

To re-enable xDrip, go back to Hardware Data Source and choose the collection system you were using before. For example, if you were using G5 or G6, that would be "G5/G6 Transmitter".
