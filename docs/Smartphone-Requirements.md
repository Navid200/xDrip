## Smartphone requirements  

**Android**    
You can use any Android phone that has Android 4.4 or above.  xDrip does not run on iOS.  

**Cell service**    
You don't need cell service on the phone in order to use xDrip as a collector.  The connection to the transmitter is established through Bluetooth.  
But, if you want to use xDrip as a follower, then, you need either data or WiFi.  

**WiFi**  
You don't need WiFi to use xDrip as a collector.  All you need is Bluetooth.  Of course, you need a way to download xDrip or any other app you need.  
But, to run xDrip as a follower, you will need data or WiFi.  Also, if you use [Nightscout](./Nightscout.md), to have a repository, you will need internet access to upload.  
But, if you occasionally lose connection, xDrip continues to work fine and issues glucose alerts when needed.
