To view the logs, tap on the top right menu button (3 dots) and choose "View Events Log".  This will open a new screen titled "Error and Event List".  You can scroll up and down to move through the logs to access older logs.  The newest logs are at the top.  
  
At the top of the screen, you can choose different categories of logs to be shown.  Please enable all if sharing logs with someone trying to help you troubleshoot.  
  
The logs can provide useful information for troubleshooting.  You can scroll up and down to go through the logs sorted by time.  
  
The logs may contain user IDs, passwords or serial numbers.  Be careful whom you are sharing them with and hide (blackout) sensitive content if necessary.
