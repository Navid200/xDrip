The logs may contain user IDs, passwords or serial numbers.  Be careful whom you are sharing them with and hide (blackout) sensitive content if necessary.  
  
At the top of the screen, you can choose different categories of logs to be shown.  Please enable all if sharing logs through a screenshot with someone trying to help you troubleshoot.  
  
At the bottom, you can tap on `Save Logs` to save a text file containing the logs.
