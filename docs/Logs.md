The logs may contain user IDs, passwords, or serial numbers. Be cautious about whom you share them with and hide (blackout) sensitive content if necessary.  
  
At the top of the screen, you can choose different categories of logs to display. Please enable all categories if sharing logs via a screenshot with someone helping you troubleshoot.  
  
At the bottom of the screen, you can tap `Save Logs` to save a text file containing the logs.  The file will be saved at /Download/xDrip-export/xDrip-log.txt.
