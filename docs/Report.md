## Report  
  
In xDrip, tap on Statistics from the top left menu button. You can swipe left or right to access a total of 3 pages. The first and the last pages are the ones you need for a report.  
At the top, tap on 90D for the past 90 days. Tap on share from the top right menu. Select your email client and email it to yourself. Go to the other page and email that one to yourself as well.  
  
Alternatively, you can create the two images from [Nightscout](./Nightscout.md).  In that case, choose "Reports" from the Nightscout menu.  Then, use "Percentile Chart" and "Distribution" to create the two images.  Make sure to choose a 3-month period up to now.   
  
Create a document using your favorite word processor. On the first page, enter your name, contact details, date, and doctor's name.  
Enter the names of your insulins and how much you take from each.  
  
Import the graph you emailed to yourself into page 2. At the top of the page, enter Ambulatory Glucose Profile Report (AGP) and the date range. Also include your Low Value and High Value (which you can find under Settings, Glucose Units) if you are using images from xDrip.  If you are using images from Nightscout, the parameters are already included in the image.    
Import the other page you emailed to yourself, containing all the parameters, into page 3. Add the date range, and your Low Value and High Value (if you are using images from xDrip and not Nightscout) on this page as well.  
  
Now print this document into a PDF file.  
You can provide this as your report to your Endocrinologist.  
  
This (with images from xDrip) only works if you have been using xDrip consistently for the past 3 months on the same device.  
Otherwise, the data in xDrip may not cover all your readings from the past 3 months. In which case, you need to first gather all the data in one database. [Nightscout](./Nightscout.md) is one option.
