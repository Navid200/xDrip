G6 Battery  
  
It's not a good idea to have a replacement transmitter stashed.  The battery ages even if you are not using the transmitter.  In fact, if you look at the transmitter box, you can see two differernt dates printed on it.  The first date is the date of manufacture.  The second date is the date the manufacturere considers the transmitter to be too old.  That's because of the expected lifetime of the battery.  
  
You can see 2 voltages (Voltage A and Voltage B) reported on the G5/G6 status page.

It's a good idea to keep track of voltage B as you use the transmitter.  For example, if you record the value every week, you will have enough to judge how the battery is doing any time.  You can see the values for the past 9 days in the logs.  You can tap on the magnifying glass symbol to search and search for volt.  That only shows the battery voltage logs.   

The voltages vary from transmitter to transmitter.  But, what is consistent, for all transmitters, is that when the battery is about to fail, voltage B starts dropping on a continuous trajectory.  That's why it's a good idea to keep track of voltage B.  

The following image shows voltage B for six different G6 transmitters.
