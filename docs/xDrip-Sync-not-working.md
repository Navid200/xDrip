## xDrip Sync not working
[xDrip](../README.md) >> [Troubleshooting](./Troubleshooting_page.md) >> xDrip Sync not working  
  
You need to use the stable release of xDrip or any one after that.  
Instructions for setting up xDrip Sync can be found [here](./xDripSync.md).  
  
The setting `Use xDrip Cloud` should be enabled on the master and all followers.  
If you experience disconnects, try disabling the setting on the master and followers, and then please [report the problem](./Contact.md).

---  
  
Ensure that `Disable all sync features` is disabled (no check mark beside it) on the master and followers.
