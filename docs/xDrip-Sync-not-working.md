## xDrip Sync not working
[xDrip](../README.md) >> [Troubleshooting](./Troubleshooting_page.md) >> xDrip Sync not working  
  
Ensure you are using the stable release of xDrip or a later version.  
Instructions for setting up xDrip Sync can be found [here](./xDripSync.md).  
  
The setting `Use xDrip Cloud` should be enabled on both the master and all follower devices.  
If you experience disconnects, try disabling this setting on both the master and followers, then [report the problem](./Contact.md).

Ensure that `Disable all sync features` is disabled (no check mark beside it) on the master and followers.
