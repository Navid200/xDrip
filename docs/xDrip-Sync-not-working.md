## xDrip Sync not working
[xDrip](../README.md) >> [Troubleshooting](./Troubleshooting_page.md) >> xDrip Sync not working  
  
You need to use an xDrip release of 2024.09.17 or later.  
The instructions for setting up xDrip Sync can be found [here](./xDripSync.md).  
The new setting `Use xDrip Cloud` should be enabled on the master and all followers.  
  
If you experience disconnects, try disabling the setting on the master ands followers.  Then, please [report the problem](./Contact.md).

Ensure that "Disable all sync features" is disabled (no check mark beside it) on the master and followers.
