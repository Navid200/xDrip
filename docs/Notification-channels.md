## Notification Channels  
  
You can enable notification channels at Settings &#8722;> Alarms and Alerts &#8722;> Glucose Alerts Settings &#8722;> Notification Channels.  
If you do, every alert will create a new Android notification channel with specific settings.  You can edit the settings of each channel.  This will allow you to customize the notifications.  
However, please note that there will be only one channel for all the alerts that are in the [Glucose Level Alerts List](Glucose-level-alerts.md).
