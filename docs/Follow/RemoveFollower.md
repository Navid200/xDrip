If you don't want a follower to be able to follow you any longer, you have to disable it on the follower side.  
If that is not possible, the only remaining way is to change the group security sync key as explained below.  

  Go to the sync setup page on the master.  Delete the sync key.  Return to the main screen.  Now, return to the sync page.  You will see a new sync key has been created for you.  
  Now, you will need to update all the followers you want to keep with this new sync key.
