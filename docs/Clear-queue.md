If you have a command in the [queue](./Transmitter-Queue.md) (G5/G6 status page) that should not be there now, you can clear the queue.

For example, if you don't have connectivity and there is a start sensor command in the queue, you should clear it.  Otherwise, after the connection is established, even if it is temporary, the command may go through.  

On the other hand, there are times a command in the queue is expected.  Every time you issue a command (start, stop, or calibrate), the command will go into the queue and wait for the next communications time slot.  In that case, you should not clear the queue.  Otherwise, you will interfere with proper operation.  

To clear the queue, tap on the dropper symbol on the main screen.

Doing this will bring up a form so that you can type in the command instead of speaking it into the microphone.
