If your phone has [always-on display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Always-on_display), you can set it up to show the xDrip widget on the screen when the phone is sleep.  

![](./images/AOD_Sample.png)  

To set up, access `Settings` &#8722;> `xDrip+ Display Settings` &#8722;> `Always On Display Settings` &#8722;> `Enable xDrip Accessibility`.  
It will take you to the Android accessibility menu.  Tap on xDrip to enable as shown below.

If doing that does not allow you to enable it, go to xDrip app info under Android settings and from the 3-dot menu at the top right, select `Allow restricted settings`.

Approve the confirmation request.

Now, repeat the process.  This time, you will be able to choose xDrip to be used for AOD on the accessibility page.  
  
By default, the widget will move all over the display.  You can limit it to sections of the display at `Settings` &#8722;> `xDrip+ Display Settings` &#8722;> `Always On Display Settings`.

The widget will only move in selected regions.  
If all or none is selected, xDrip will move the widget all over the screen, which is the default setting.
