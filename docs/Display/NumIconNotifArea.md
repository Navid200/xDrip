On some phones, you can show the glucose reading in the notification area, even when xDrip is minimized.  
To set this up, go to Settings &#8722;> xDrip+ Display Settings &#8722;> Number icon in Notification Area.

On that page, test it first.  Enable "Number Icon tested".  
Enable "Show small number icon".
