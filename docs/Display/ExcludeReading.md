You can mark a reading as a bad reading and exclude it from statistics.  
To do that, you will need to use the [data table](../Datatables.md).  Open the readings data table.  Find the reading.  Long press it.  You will see a prompt to flag the reading as bad.  Answer with yes or no.  If you flag a reading as bad, the color of the point representing the reading will change and the reading will be excluded from the statistics.
