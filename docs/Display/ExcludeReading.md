## Exclude a reading
[xDrip](../../README.md) >> [Features](../Features_page.md) >> [Display](./Display.md) >> Exclude a reading  
  
You can mark a reading as a bad reading and exclude it from statistics.  
To do that, you will need to use the [data table](../Datatables.md).  Open the readings data table.  Find the reading.  Long press it.  You will see a prompt to flag the reading as bad.  Answer with yes or no.  If you flag a reading as bad, the color of the point representing the reading will change and the reading will be excluded from the statistics.  
  
You can undo that, by using the data table again.  Go to the data table.  Long press the reading you want to unmark.  In the promp that comes up, choose no to unmark the reading.  It will become a normal reading again.
