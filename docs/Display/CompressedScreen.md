## Exclude a reading
[xDrip](../../README.md) >> [Features](../Features_page.md) >> [Display](./Display.md) >> Compressed screen  
  
Do you have a screen with the vertical (y) axis expanded as shown below?

#### **Flags**  
There is an open issue for the start/stop flags being placed at unusally high values:  
[Issue](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/issues/3081)  

Until the issue is resolved, you can delete the flags.  Otherwise, you will have to wait 24 hours from the time of the flags for the screen to return to normal.  
To delte the flags, follow the same instructions used to [delete a treatment](../Delete_Treatment.md).

#### **High readings**  
If you have a very high reading that is greater than the [chosen visible max](./GlucoseRange.md), the y axis range could externd in order for the reading to be visible.  
If this reading is a valid reading, meaning you indeed had a high reading, you should wait 24 hours for the screen to return to normal.  
On the other hand, if this reading is an error caused by the measurement equipment, you can [mark the reading as bad](./ExcludeReading.md).  Then, it will have no impact on the y axis.
