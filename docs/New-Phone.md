## Transfer to a new phone

If you like to have your previous readings on your new phone, this is about how you should do it.  
  
Be very careful. xDrip cannot _import_ a database.  It can only _restore_ a database.  What it does is to replace the existing database with the one being restored.  
Effectively, xDrip deletes the entire existing database and then replaces it with the new database.  
  
The best course of action is to restore the database into the new phone before setting it up as a collector.  Otherwise, if you start collection on the new phone, restoring a database after will overwrite every collection.  The following list shows the recommended sequence.  
  
1. Create a [backup](./Backup-Database.md) from the old phone.
2. Transfer the backed up database and settings file to the new phone.  
3. Install xDrip on the new phone.  
4. Restore the database only if you have not already started collection, or if you are willing to lose the new readings.
