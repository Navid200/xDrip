## Transfer to a new phone

Be very careful. xDrip cannot import a database; it can only restore one. This means that xDrip will replace the existing database with the one being restored, effectively deleting the entire existing database and then replacing it with the new one.   
  
To avoid losing data, restore the database on the new phone before setting it up as a collector. If you start collecting data on the new phone before restoring the database, any new collections will be overwritten when you restore.   
  
Follow these steps:  
1. Create a [backup](./Backup-Database.md) from the old phone.
2. Transfer the backup database and settings file to the new phone.  
3. Install xDrip on the new phone.  
4. Restore the database only if you have not already started collecting data, or if you are willing to lose any new readings since the time the backup file was created.
