Tap on App battery usage.  Depending on the manufacturer of the phone, you may see different items.  The objective is to disable battery optimization of Bluetooth.  
On some phones, it may be called "Unrestricted".  
For some Android levels, the app may be called Legacy Bluetooth.  
Disable battery optimization or set battery usage to "Unrestricted".
