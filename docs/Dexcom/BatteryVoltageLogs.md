## Battery voltage logs  
[xDrip](../../README.md) >> [Features](../Features_page.md) >> [xDrip & Dexcom](../Dexcom_page.md) >> Battery voltage logs  
  
If you use xDrip as a collector, battery voltages are saved and kept for 9 days in the [logs](../Logs.md). To view these logs, tap on the magnifying glass symbol while viewing the logs and enter "volt" in the search field. This will filter the logs to only show battery voltage information. An example is provided below:

Pay attention to the dates and times on the left. The items at the top are the most recent.    

Focus on the "Voltage B" values. If you notice that the value has been decreasing rapidly, the battery could be causing the connectivity issues you are experiencing.
