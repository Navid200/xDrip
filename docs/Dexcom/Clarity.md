### **Reports**  
Clarity is not the only way to create a report for your doctor.  
xDrip can upload to Tidepool and you can use Tidepool to create reports.  

You can use Nightscout, or even xDrip, and a simple word processor to create a report yourself.  [This](../Report.md) explains how.

### **Doctor suggests Clarity**  
Your doctor is an important member of your team and you need to work with them.  
So, you should not disagree with your doctor.  But, you can ask questions.  You can show your dcotor a report and ask if he/she may find it acceptable even though it is not Clarity.  
That's what I did and when my doctor saw my report, she was happy with it and never asked for Clarity anymore.

### **What's wrong with Clarity?**  
There is nothing wrong with Clarity itself.  But, since xDrip cannot upload to it, you will have to use a different app that can upload to clarity and have it pass the readings to xDrip.  Then, if either xDrip or that app goes down, you will have no readings in xDrip.

### **If Clarity is a requirement**  
If your doctor does not accept your suggestion to use an alternative report or your insurance requires that you use Clarity, you will have to use Clarity.  

#### **Dexcom receiver**  
Dexcom recceiver can upload to Clarity.  If you get a Dexcom receiver, you can carry it with you and it can coexist with an app like xDrip collecting from the same Dexcom device.  
Once a month, you can connect the receiver using a USB cable to your computer to upload to Clarity.  

If you use G7, or One+, you only need to turn on the receiver once a day as G7 backfills 24 hours.  

#### **BYODA**  
You can try [BYODA](../DexcomAppxDrip.md).  
If it has an option for the Dexcom sensor you use and if it has the option to broadcast to xDrip, you will be able to get readings in xDrip.  
  
#### **Companion app**  
You can run Dexcom app on your phone and use the [Companion app](../Follow/CompanionApp.md) mode in xDrip to pass the readings to xDrip.
