## xDrip and Clarity
[xDrip](../../README.md) >> [Features](../Features_page.md) >> [xDrip & Dexcom](../Dexcom_page.md) >> Clarity  
  
xDrip can directly collect from [G6/Dexcom One](../Starting-G6.md), or [G7/One+](./G7.md).  
xDrip cannot upload to Clarity.

### **Reports**  
Clarity is not the only way to create a report for your doctor.  
xDrip can upload to Tidepool and you can use Tidepool to create reports.  

You can use Nightscout, or even xDrip, and a simple word processor to create a report yourself.  [This](../Report.md) explains how.

### **Doctor suggests Clarity**  
Your doctor is an important member of your team, and itâ€™s important to work with them. While you should generally follow your doctor's advice, you can ask questions. Show your doctor a report and enquire if they might find it acceptable, even if it is not from Clarity. I did this, and when my doctor saw my report, she was satisfied with it and no longer required Clarity.

### **If Clarity is a requirement**  
If your doctor does not accept alternative reports or if your insurance requires you to use Clarity, you will need to use Clarity.  
  
#### **Dexcom receiver**  
The Dexcom receiver can upload data to Clarity. If you get a Dexcom receiver, you can carry it with you, and it can coexist with an app like xDrip collecting data from the same Dexcom device. Once a month, you can connect the receiver to your computer via USB to upload data to Clarity.  
  
If you use the G7 or One+, you only need to turn on the receiver once a day, as the G7 backfills data for 24 hours.  
  
#### **BYODA**  
You can try [BYODA](../DexcomAppxDrip.md). If it supports the Dexcom sensor you use and has the option to broadcast data to xDrip, you will be able to get readings in xDrip.  
  
#### **Companion app**  
You can run the Dexcom app on your phone and use the [Companion app mode](../Follow/CompanionApp.md) in xDrip to pass readings to xDrip.

### **Summary**  
  
|       Method    | Advantage | Disadvantage |  
| --------------- | --------- | ------------ |  
| xDrip collector | Easy | Does not support Clarity |  
| Receiver | Easy xDrip setup | Requires a receiver |  
| BYODA | Supports Clarity | Not every sensor is compatible; potential two points of failure: xDrip and BYODA |  
| Companion app | Supports Clarity | Potential two points of failure: xDrip and the companion app; if either fails, no readings in xDrip |
