## Why can I not start or stop G7?  
[xDrip](../../README.md) >> [Features](../Features_page.md) >> [xDrip & Dexcom](../Dexcom_page.md) >> Why no start or stop for G7!  
  
A G7 (or One+) session starts automatically on the device as soon as you use the applicator to insert the device.  
There is no need to manually start the session.  
  
With the G6 transmitter, you could use it for up to 110 days, meaning you could use up to 11 sensors in sequence on a single G6 transmitter.  When you start a new G6 sensor, you must first stop the previous sensor;  ensure that the transmitter is outside the sensor for at least 10 minutes before starting the new session.  Failure to do so may cause the transmitter to detect a false restart attempt and stop the session.  
This is why it's necessary to be able to stop a G6 sensor.  
  
In contrast, G7 integrates both the sensor and transmitter into a single device.  Once you are done using it, you cannot reuse it.  There will be no restart attempt detection with the G7 because the session starts automatically as soon as you use the applicator and insert the device.    
Therefore, there is no need to stop a G7.  
  
You might hope that if you stop a G7, it could prevent interference with your next G7.  
A G7 device continues to send Bluetooth transmissions every 5 minutes as long as it has battery, which lasts more than 100 days. Stopping the device will not affect its transmission.  
  
To avoid accidental stoppage, the ability to stop a G7 has been removed. There is no need to stop a G7, and removing this option ensures you wonâ€™t unintentionally disrupt its function.
