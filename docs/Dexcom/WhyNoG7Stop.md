## Why no G7 Stop!  
[xDrip](../../README.md) >> [Features](../Features_page.md) >> [xDrip & Dexcom](../Dexcom_page.md) >> Why no stop sensor for G7!  
  
When you use G6, and want to start a new sensor, you need to stop the previous one.  Then, you need to make sure the transmitter is outside the sensor for at least 10 minutes before starting the new session.  If you don't, the transmitter may stop the session because of a false restart attempt detection.  
Keeping the transmitter out for at least 10 minutes guarantees that a false restart attempt will not trigger.  
But, this is why we need to be able to stop a sensor when using G6.  

With G7, you only have one device, sensor and transmitter.  When you are done using it, you cannot use it again.  There will never be a restart attempt detected.  A G7 session starts automatically as soon as you use the applicator and insert a G7 device.  
There is never a reason to stop a G7.  
But, you could accidentally stop a G7 and then feel sorry you did.  To avoid that possibility, we have removed the ability to stop a G7.  
You will never ever need to stop a G7.  So, why have it?  
  
Currently, you can still access the stop command when using a G7 if you enable engineering mode in xDrip.  Bt, this will eventually be removed.  
Please don't stop a G7.  If you feel that you need to stop a G7, please [contact me](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/discussions) and tell me why.
