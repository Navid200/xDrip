## New G6 or Dexcom One transmitter activation  

[xDrip](../../README.md) >> [Features](../Features_page.md) >> [xDrip & Dexcom](../Dexcom_page.md) >> New G6 or Dexcom One transmitter activation    
  
When you first receive a new G6 or Dexcom One transmitter, it needs to be activated before it can be used with xDrip or any other app or even a Dexcom receiver.  This is to minimize the power consumption of a transmitter while it is still in the box.  
However, you should only activate a transmitter when you intend to use it.  After you do, you will not be able to deactivate it.  
  
Snapping the transmitter into an inserted sensor will activate it.  
Alternatively, you can hold a new transmitter in your hand with your thumb pressed against the contacts for a minute to activate it.
