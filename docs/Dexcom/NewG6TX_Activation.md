## New G6 or Dexcom One transmitter activation

When you first receive a new G6 or Dexcom One transmitter, it needs to be activated before it can be used with xDrip or any other app or even a Dexcom receiver.  This is to minimize the power consumption of a transmitter while it is still in the box.  
However, you should only activate a transmitter when you intend to use it.  After you do, you will not be able to deactivate it.  
  
Snapping the transmitter into an inserted sensor will activate it.  
Alternatively, you can hold a new transmitter in your hand with your thumb pressed against the contacts for a minute to activate it.  
  
If you are going to insert a transmitter into a brand new sensor, it is a good idea to clean the transmitter contacts (not the sensor contacts) with rubbing alcohol to remove any residue from your skin.  
On the other hand, if you are restarting a sensor and have removed the transmitter from an active sensor, do not touch the contacts and do not use rubbing alcohol as the oily residue on the contacts is Petroleum jelly required for providing a perfect seal between the sensor and the transmitter.
