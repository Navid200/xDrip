When you first receive a new G6 transmitter, it needs to be activated before it can be used.  This is to minimize the power consuption of a transmitter while it is still in the box.  
However, you should only activate a transmitter when you intend to use it.  After you do, you will not be able to deactivate it.  
  
Snapping the transmitter into an inserted sensor willl activate it.  
Alternatively, you can hold a new transmitter in your hand with your thumb pressed against the contacts for a minute or two to activate it.
