You should not use xDrip for making any medical (dosing) decisions.  
  
- If you have the Dexcom app installed, uninstall it.  
  
- You need an xDrip release of [April 13, 2023](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/releases/tag/2023.04.13) or later.  
  
- Use Settings &#8722;> Auto configure to scan the QR code shown below. You should see a message like this:  
![](./images/keks_QR_confirm.png)  
  
If you don't see such a message, please do not approve loading any settings.  Please stop and inform us.

If you see the expected message, please approve loading the settings.  

- Insert the sensor.  Take note of the 4-digit pairing code shown on the sensor inserter casing.  
  
- Set up xDrip as if you were going to use [G6](../G6-Recommended-Settings.md).  
  
- Enter the 4 digit pairing code shown on the sensor inserter casing as the transmitter id.  
  
- Go to the [G6 status page](../StatusG5G6.md), and wait for connection.  
Approve the pairing request.

If there is a session in progress, you will see readings.  If you have just inserted a new device, you will see warmup.  
  
If you see "Mismatch" on the status page, it means either your pairing code is wrong or there is another sensor nearby. Check that pairing code is correct and wait for connection.  
Over time, the status page will populate with other data elements, time remaining etc.
