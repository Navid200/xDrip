## G7 or One+

This is how you can use xDrip to collect directly from a G7 or One+.

#### **Start a G7 or One+ (inserting the sensor)**  
Before inserting a new sensor, use a pen to mark the old one to avoid accidentally removing the wrong sensor later.  
  
While checking that the sensor is not [damaged](./G7ApplicatorFailures.md), follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions to use the applicator for inserting the sensor. The session on G7 or One+ will start automatically once the sensor is inserted. There is [no need to manually stop or start](./WhyNoG7Stop.md) anything.  
  
Take note of the 4-digit pairing code displayed on the sensor applicator, as you will need it to establish connectivity later.

#### **Establish connectivity to G7 or One+**  
  
1- If you have the Dexcom app (or any other app collecting from G7 or One+) installed, uninstall it.  Having a Dexcom receiver or t:slim pump is OK, and you don't need to disable them.  
  
2- Go to Android Settings &#8722;> Connected devices.  
Forget all devices whose names are DXCM\*\*,  DX01\*\* or DX02\*\*, where \*\* could be any two characters.  
  
3- Ensure xDrip is updated to at least the [August 2, 2024 release](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/releases/tag/2024.08.02).  
[How to Update](../Updates.md)  
  
4- [Scan the QR code](../Settings/Scan_QR_Code.md) shown below if you haven't already.  This step is not required for every sensor.

You should see a message like this:

Approve importing the settings.  
<br/>  
  
5- Set up xDrip, and your phone, as explained [here](../G6-Recommended-Settings.md).  It is crucial to review and confirm all settings, as the QR code does not automatically configure them.  
  
6- Ensure your old G7 or One+ devices are out of range or place them inside the microwave. This is optional but may speed up the pairing process.  
  
7-  Enter the 4-digit pairing code from the sensor applicator as the transmitter ID.

<br/>  
  
8- Go to the [Dex status page](../StatusG5G6.md), and wait for connection.  
Approve the pairing request you will receive if you are using Android 10 or newer.  
<br/>  
  
If you inserted the sensor more than 30 minutes ago, you will see readings.  If you have just inserted a sensor, you will see warmup.  
Over time, the status page will populate with other data elements, time remaining etc.  
<br/>

#### **Troubleshooting**    
If you see "Mismatch" on the status page, it means either your pairing code is wrong or there is another sensor nearby. Check that pairing code is correct and wait for connection.
