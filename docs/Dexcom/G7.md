#### **Starting (inserting) the sensor**  
Before inserting a new sensor, use a pen to mark the old one to avoid accidentally removing the wrong sensor later.  
  
While checking that the sensor is not [damaged](./G7ApplicatorFailures.md), follow the manufacturer’s instructions for using the applicator to insert the sensor.
The session will start automatically once the sensor is inserted. There is [no need to manually stop or start](./WhyNoG7Stop.md) anything.  
  
Take note of the 4-digit pairing code displayed on the sensor applicator, as you will need it to establish connectivity later.

#### **Establishing Connectivity**  
  
1- If you have the Dexcom app (or any other app collecting from the sensor) installed, uninstall it.  It is okay to have a Dexcom receiver or t:slim, and you don’t need to disable them.  
  
2- Go to Android Settings &#8722;> Connected devices.  
Forget all devices whose names are DXCM\*\*,  DX01\*\* or DX02\*\*, where \*\* could be any two characters.  
  
3- Ensure xDrip is updated to at least the stable release.  
[How to Update](../Updates.md)  
  
4- [Scan the QR code](../Settings/Scan_QR_Code.md) shown below if you haven't already.  This step is not required for every sensor.

You should see a message like this:

Approve importing the settings.  
<br/>  
  
5- Set up xDrip, and your phone, as explained [here](../G6-Recommended-Settings.md).  It is crucial to review and confirm all settings, as the QR code does not automatically configure them.  
  
6- Ensure your old G7 or One+ devices are out of range or place them inside the microwave. This is optional but may speed up the pairing process.  
  
7-  Enter the 4-digit pairing code from the sensor applicator as the transmitter ID.

<br/>  
  
8- Go to the [Dex status page](../StatusG5G6.md), and wait for connection.  
Approve the pairing request you will receive if you are using Android 10 or newer.  
If you see "Deep Sleeping errors," it may help to restart the phone.  

If you see "Deep Sleeping errors", it may help to restart the phone.  
<br/>  
  
If you inserted the sensor more than 30 minutes ago, you will see readings.  If you have just inserted a sensor, you will see warmup.  
Over time, the status page will populate with other data elements, time remaining etc.
