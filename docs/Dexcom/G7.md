## G7 or One+  
[xDrip](../../README.md) >> [Features](../Features_page.md) >> [xDrip & Dexcom](../Dexcom_page.md) >> Dexcom G7 or One+  
  
This is how you can use xDrip to collect directly from a G7 or One+.  
**<span style="color:red">Never stop a G7 or One+.</span>**  There is no reason to stop a G7 or One+.  If you stop it, you will not be able to use the device again, not even with your pump, not even with your Dexcom receiver.

#### **Start a G7 or One+ (inserting the sensor)**  

All you need to do to start a G7, or One+, is to follow the manufacturer's instructions to use the applicator to insert the sensor.  The session will automatically start upon inserting the sensor.  
Take note of the 4-digit pairing code shown on the sensor applicator as you will need it when establishing connectivity.

#### **Establish connectivity to G7 or One+**  
  
1- If you have the Dexcom app installed, uninstall it.  
  
2- Go to Android Settings &#8722;> Connected devices.  
Forget all devices whose names are DXCM\*\* or DX02\*\* where \*\* could be any two characters.  
  
3- Please update xDrip to the January 16, 2024 release.
For One+, you at least need the February 14, 2024 release.  
[How to Update](../Updates.md)  
  
4- Use `Settings` &#8722;> `Auto configure` to scan the QR code shown below if you haven't already.

You don't need to do this for every sensor.  
  
You should see a message like this:  
![](./images/keks_QR_confirm.png)  
  
Approve importing the settings.  
<br/>  
  
5- Set up xDrip, and your phone, as explained [here](../G6-Recommended-Settings.md).  It is very important to go over the settings and confirm they are all correct.  The QR code you scanned does not do that.  
  
6- Make sure your old used G7 or One+ devices are out of range, or place them inside the microwave.  This is not necessary.  But, it will speed up pairing.  
  
7- Enter the 4-digit pairing code shown on the sensor applicator as the transmitter id.

<br/>  
  
8- Go to the [G5/G6/G7 status page](../StatusG5G6.md), and wait for connection.  
Approve the pairing request you will receive if you are using Android 10 or newer.  
<br/>  
  
If you inserted the sensor more than 30 minutes ago, you will see readings.  If you have just inserted a sensor, you will see warmup.  
Over time, the status page will populate with other data elements, time remaining etc.

#### **Starting a subsequent G7 or One+**  
This is the recommended approach for starting your next device after you have been using one already.  
  
When the status page shows 10 days for transmitter days, or after the optional sensor expiry note on the main screen shows 12 hours, insert a new sensor following the section above titled "Start a G7 or One+".

You can use a phone, other than your main xDrip phone, to establish connectivity to your new device to confirm that it is working.  To do that, follow the instructions under the heading "Establish connectivity to G7 or One+" above using the other phone.  
However, you should disable this phone before proceeding to switch to the new device on your main phone.  
  
When your current sensor stops working after its 10.5 day period ends, or before, proceed with the following.  
  
1- If you haven't disabled the test phone, do it now.  You can [disable collection](../Stop-xDrip.md) on it.  
2- On your main phone, follow the instructions under the heading "Establish connectivity to G7 or One+" above to connect to your new device.  
3- Peel off the old sensor.  Make sure not to peel off the new one.  
<br/>

#### **Troubleshooting**    
If you see "Mismatch" on the status page, it means either your pairing code is wrong or there is another sensor nearby. Check that pairing code is correct and wait for connection.
