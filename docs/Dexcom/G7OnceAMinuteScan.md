## G7 Once a minute scan mode  
[xDrip](../../README.md) >> [Features](../Features_page.md) >> [xDrip & Dexcom](../Dexcom_page.md) >> Dexcom G7 once a minute scan  
  
A G7 (or One+) device transmits once every 5 minutes.  
The communication between a G7 and an app is a two-way communication.  There is an acknowledgment mechanism involved.  
If a G7 misses three consecutive acknowledgments, it switches to once a minute transmissions in order to help to reconnect, and this will continue for 12 hours or until the app successfully reconnects.
