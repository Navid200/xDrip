In short, because you don't need to.  If you want the long answer, please read on!  

A G7 (or One+) session starts automatically on the device as soon as you use the applicator to insert the device.  
There is nothing to start.  
  
You could use 11 sensors on the same G6 transmitter.  You had to stop one before you could start the next since it would have to run on the same transmitter.  
This is not the case with a G7.  The G7 sensor and transmitter are combined.  You have no way of starting a G7 device again after it stops working.  
Therefore, it would be pointless to stop G7.  

You may think that if you stop a G7 when you are done with it, it will stop transmitting and less chance of it interfering with your next G7.  
You would be wrong to think that.  A G7 device continues to send a Bluetooth transmission once every 5 minutes as long as it has battery, which takes more than 100 days.  Stopping it  will make no difference.
