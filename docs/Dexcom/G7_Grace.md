## G7 or One+ Grace period

[This guide](./G7.md) explains how to set up xDrip to use G7 or One+.  
  
A G7 device runs for 10.5 days. Dexcom refers to the extra 12 hours beyond the standard 10-day period as the grace period. You have several options for taking advantage of this grace period, and you can also use a combination of these methods.  
<br/>  
  
1- Flexibility  
Using each sensor for the full 10 days allows the extra 12 hours to offer flexibility. For instance, if an unexpected errand arises exactly on the 10th day and you cannot start the new sensor as planned, you will have an additional 12 hours to complete the errand and start the new sensor while the old one remains functional.  

2- Extended run time  
You can opt to use each sensor for the full 10.5 days instead of 10. To do this, if you start a sensor at 7:00 AM, you must start the next one at 7:00 PM. This means youâ€™ll alternate between starting sensors in the morning and evening. Using each sensor for 10.5 days, 9 sensors will last you a total of 94.5 days.  
  
3- Presoak  
You can insert your new sensor while the old one is still operational. For example, you might insert your new sensor at 7:00 AM but keep the old sensor active until 7:00 PM. This way, when the old sensor stops working, the new sensor will have already been active for several hours. Since readings from a new sensor can be unstable initially, this method helps you avoid unreliable readings by having the old sensor in use while the new one "warms up".  
<br/>  

How you use the extra 12 hours is up to you.

#### **xDrip sensor expiry**  
xDrip considers a G7 sensor to run for 10.5 days and then expire. Therefore, when you start a sensor, xDrip will indicate that the sensor will expire in 10.5 days.
