## Engineering Mode
[xDrip](../README.md) >> [Features](./Features_page.md) >> xDrip Engineering mode  
  
The xDrip functions that are not fully tested or are meant to be tested, or are meant to be used only in certain conditions that are not quite normal are only accessible in the engineering mode.  
No one should need to enable xDrip engineering mode under normal circumstances.

The microphone will open.  Say "Enable engineering mode".  

If this does not work, long press on the microphone symbol instead of tapping on it.  A form will open up.  Type in it "enable engineering mode" without the quotes and enter.
