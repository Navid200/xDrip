## Pull Request  
[xDrip](../../README.md) >> [Development](./Development) >> [Pull Request](./PR_How)  

Try to make it as easy as possible to review by someone who doesn't know anything about and has not experienced the problem.  
  
### Make multiple small steps rather than a single giant step  
The more changes you include in a single PR, the harder it will be for the reviewer to convince themselves to approve.  Even if you have a perfect solution, it will be useless if it is never merged.  You can make multiple small PRs, one step at a time.  
  
### Explain the problem
Not everyone uses xDrip the same way.  The reviewer may have never experienced the problem you are trying to solve.  
The first question you should answer, without being asked, is "why we need this change".  
Explain what the problem is.  This does not have to be very long.  In fact, it should be as short as possible.  
Even if there is an issue or discussion about the problem, that you are linking, you should still have a short decription of the problem in your PR description.  

### How can it be recreated?
Explain the steps one has to take to experience the problem.  Your description will go a long way if it can clearly show how to recreate the problem.  
  
### Links
If there is an issue or discussion that explains the problem, include links.  
  
### Images
If you are changing a menu item, include before and after images.
