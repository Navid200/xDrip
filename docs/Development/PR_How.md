### Make multiple small steps rather than a single giant step  
The more changes you make, the harder it will be for the reviewr to convince themselves to approve.  Even if yo have a perfect solution, it will be useless if it is never merged.  
  
### Explain the problem
Look at your description from the point of view of the reviewer.  
Not everyone uses xDrip the same way.  The reviewer may have never experienced the problem you are trying to solve.  
The first question you should answer without being asked is "why we need this change".  
Explain what the problem is.  This does not have to be long.  In fact, it should be as short as possible.  
Even if there is an issue or description about the problem you are trying to resolve, you should still have a short decription of the problem in your PR.  

If you are changing a menu item, include before and after images.  

Try to make it as easy as possible to review by someone who doesn't know anything about and has not experienced the problem.  

### Links
If there is an issue or discussion that explains the problem, include links.
