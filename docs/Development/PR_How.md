Look at your description from the point of view of the reviewer.  
Not everyone uses xDrip the same way.  
  
The first question you should answer without being asked is "why we need this change".  
Explain what the problem is.  This does not have to be long.  In fact, it shoulkd be as short as possible.  
Even if there is a, issue or description about the problem you are trying to resolve, you should still have a short decription of the problem in your PR.  

If there is an issue or discussion that explains the problem, add a link to them.  

If you are changing a menu item, include before and after images.
