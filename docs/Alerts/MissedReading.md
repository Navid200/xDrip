## Missed Reading Alert
[xDrip](../../README.md) >> [Features](../Features_page.md) >> [xDrip Alerts](../Alerts_page.md) >> Missed Reading alert  
  
xDrip can alert you if you have had no readings for a certain amount of time.  It is called the missed reading alert.

To enable it, go to `Settings` &#8722;> `Alarms and Alerts` &#8722;> `Missed reading Alert`.  
  
This alert uses the same settings for override do not disturb or the sound file from other alerts at `Settings` &#8722;> `Alarms and Alerts` &#8722;> `Other Alerts`.  Those two settings are at the very bottom of that page.

Unfortunately, this alert does not use the volume profile.  At least, not yet.  Therefore, if you lower your phone's volume, this alert will play at that lower volume.  
I hope to change this in the near future such that this alert would use the chosen volume profile.
