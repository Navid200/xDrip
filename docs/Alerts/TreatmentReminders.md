## Treatment Reminder
[xDrip](../../README.md) >> [Features](../Features_page.md) >> [xDrip Alerts](../Alerts_page.md) >> Why do I get treatment reminders?  
  
xDrip automatically creates a reminder for a treatment that is more than 1 minute in the future.  
  
If the treatments come from another phone, make sure that the two phones are set to update their time and date from the internet.  This will ensure there will be no time difference between the two phones.
