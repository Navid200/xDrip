### **Request for Help**  
If you need assistance with xDrip, please post in [discussions](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/discussions). When creating your initial post, include the following information:  
  
- Specify the device attached to the sensor (e.g. Dexcom G6 or MIAOMIAO).  
- Provide the brand and model of your phone, as well as the Android version it is running.  
- A screenshot of the [system status page](./StatusG5G6.md) (you may blackout serial numbers).  
- A screenshot of the [Hardware Data Source page](./HardwareDataSource.md).  
- Include a brief description of the problem (e.g., “No readings” or “Sensor Stopped”).  
- Mention if anything has recently changed, such as a new phone, an Android patch, a specific xDrip release, or a new sensor that might have triggered the issue.

- **<span style="color:red">Opening New Issues.</span>**  
Please do not open a new issue directly. We prefer to manage issues through [discussions](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/discussions). Many problems can be resolved by adjusting xDrip settings with no need to modify the xDrip code. This helps us better prioritize and address real problems.  
If the discussion reveals a genuine issue, we will convert it into an official issue for further investigation.  
  
- Avoid replying to emails from GitHub as this will quote previous messages and clutter the thread.  Instead, please log into GitHub and respond in a post in the discussion thread.  
  
- Do not include personal information such as user IDs, passwords, full names, addresses, or phone numbers in your post. While some of this information might appear in xDrip logs or status pages, you should blackout such details before posting. However, details like your xDrip version and the firmware version of your transmitter are important for troubleshooting and should not be omitted from your screenshots.  
  
### **Suggestions**  
To suggest new features or improvements, please post in the [discussions](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/discussions). We welcome your input, but keep in mind that adding new features can increase the complexity of xDrip and introduce new bugs that need to be fixed. Therefore, while we value your suggestions, please be patient with the implementation process.  
  
### **Feedback**  
If you notice unclear documentation, errors, or if you think a topic should be added, please post in [discussions](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/discussions). Include a link to the specific document or page you’re referring to for better clarity.
