### Request for Help  
If you need help using xDrip, please post in [discussions](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/discussions).  
include the following in the first post.  
- What device is attached to the sensor. For example, Dexcom G6, or MIAOMIAO.   
- What brand and model is the phone, and what Android version is on the phone?  
- A screenshot of the [system status page](./StatusG5G6.md) (you can blackout serial numbers)  
- A screenshot of the [Hardware Data Source page](./HardwareDataSource.md)  

Include a short description of what is wrong. For example "No readings", or "Sensor Stopped".  
Also, state if there is something that has changed. For example, is this a new phone, did you recently receive an Android patch, if the problem only occurs with a particular release of xDrip, if you are new to xDrip, or if a new sensor started the issue.  

**<span style="color:red">Please don't open an issue.</span>**  
Please allow us to manage the issues.  There used to be too many issues opened up by users.  Many could just be addressed by using xDrip differently.  In the meantime, there were always too many open issues and there was no way for the developers to know which ones were real.  
Please help us manage the issues more efficiently by opening a [discussion](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/discussions) instead of an issue.  If it turns out to be an issue, we will convert the discussion into an issue.  

- Please don't respond by replying to an email from GitHub.  Doing that will quote previous messages cluttering the thread.  
  
#### What you shouldn't include  
Items like user IDs, passwords, full name, address, phone number etc. can identify you or something that belongs to you.  We don't need any of those in order to help you.  Some of those information may be included in xDrip logs or shown on status pages.  You can blackout such information before posting.  
On the other hand, the xDrip version you are using or the firmware version of the transmitter you are using are very important and can be relevant and will not compromise your privacy.  So, please don't leave those out of your screenshots.  
  
  
### Suggestions 
To reach out to developers, post in the [discussions](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/discussions).  
xDrip is constantly being improved and your suggestions are welcome.  But, please note that there is a price to pay for every new feature.  xDrip needs to be maintained and documented.  That means xDrip bugs need to be fixed.  The more features there are, the more complicated the bugs will become.  
Please post your suggestions.  But, please be patient.  
  
  
### Feedback  
If you find an item in the documentation that is not explained clearly, or if you like a subject to be added, or if you have found errors, please post in [discussions](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/discussions).  Please include in your post a link to the document to clarify which page you are referring to.
