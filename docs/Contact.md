### Requests for Help  
If you need help using xDrip, please post in [discussions](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/discussions) or [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/xDripG5).  
include the following in the first post.  
- What device is attached to the sensor.  
- Is xDrip the collector or a follower?  
- If the collector, what brand and model is the phone, and what Android version is on the phone?  
- If a follower, what follower scheme is used?  
- A snapshot of the system status page (you can blackout serial numbers)  
- A snapshot of the classic status page (you can blackout serial numbers)  

Include a short description of what is wrong. For example "No readings", or "Sensor Stopped".  
Also, state if there is something that has changed. For example, is this a new phone, or did you recently receive an Android patch, if the problem only occurs with a particular release of xDrip, or if you are new to xDrip, or if a new sensor started the issue.
