## Install xDrip  
[xDrip](../README.md) >> [Download & Installation](./Installation_page.md) >> Install xDrip  
  
After having [downloaded](./Download-xDrip) the .apk file, you can install by tapping on it.  
If you have never installed xDrip on the phone, you may see the following note:

Tap on "Settings".  That will bring up this form:  
![](./images/AllowFromThisSource.png)  
  
Enable "Allow from this source" and go back.  Now, you will see this:  
![](./images/WantToInstall.png)  
  
Tap on "Install".

Or, you may see this:

Tap on "More details".  Now, you will see this:  
![](./images/UnsafeAppBlocked2.png)  
  
Tap on "Install anyway".  
  
xDrip is not in the Google Play store as explained [here](./App-store.md).  
Because of that, in the above forms, you are encouraged to tap on "Got it", which will abandon the installation.  The "Got it" option is highlighted and centered to get your attention.  
However, please note that you can also tap on "More details" and "Install anyway" in the above forms also.  And that's what you need to do in order to install xDrip.
