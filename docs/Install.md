[xDrip](../README.md) >> [Download & Installation](./Installation_page.md) >> Install xDrip  
  
After [downloading](./Download-xDrip.md) the xDrip .apk file, locate it in your file manager and tap on it to start the installation process.  
  
If you have another xDrip release installed from the [Nightscout Foundation](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip), you can install the new version directly over the existing one without uninstalling the previous version.  
  
If xDrip was installed from a different repository, you cannot install the new version over it. In this case:  
Before uninstalling the old version, ensure you [back up](./Backup.md) your data.  Uninstall the existing version.  Proceed with the installation of the new version.  After installation, restore your backup to recover your old readings and settings if needed.
