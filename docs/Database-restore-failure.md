[xDrip](../README.md) >> [Troubleshooting](./Troubleshooting_page.md) >> Restore database failure  
  
If you are using Android 11 or newer and restoring the database fails, try restoring it three or 4 times.  It will work the third or fourth time.  
This was an [issue](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/issues/1705), that has been fixed starting with the January 18, 2023 release.
