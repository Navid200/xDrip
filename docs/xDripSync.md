## xDrip Sync Follow  
  
This page explains how to set up xDrip Sync.  
This is easy to set up. But, it relies on Google.  
  
On master, go to Settings −> xDrip+ Sync settings, and tap on "Be master for followers".  
**<span style="color:red">Disable "Allow follower actions". Otherwise, the follower will be able to stop the sensor on master.</span>**  
Ensure "Disable all sync features", at the bottom of the page, is disabled.  
Tap on Settings −> Show Settings QR codes.  
Tap on xDrip plus security key settings only.  
  
On the follower, tap on Settings -> Auto configure.  
Scan the QR code shown on the master screen. This will change all the settings, on the follower, to follow the master.  
Ensure Settings −> xDrip+ Sync settings −> Disable all sync features is disabled on the follower.  

In some cases, the scan does not work. You can manually set up the follower:  
Under Settings −> Hardware Data Source, select xDrip+ Sync Follower.  
Then, go to Settings −> xDrip+ Sync Settings and tap on "Handset Group Security Sync Key". Make sure the key matches the key on the same page on the master.  

On both master and follower ensure that Settings −> xDrip+ Sync Settings −> Disable all sync features is disabled.
