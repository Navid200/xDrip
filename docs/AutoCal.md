## Automatic Calibration

You can enter blood glucose measurements, that you perform using your blood glucose meter, into xDrip to keep records.  
If you enable automatic calibration, xDrip will monitor readings for several read cycles and if the trend is not rapid, it will use the blood glucose reading for calibration with a time parameter added.  This means the calibration is entered in the past, when the measurement was entered.  
  
xDrip will only use a measurement entry for calibration if the conditions are met guaranteeing accuracy.  Otherwise, xDrip will not use the reading for a calibration.  
This can be used for readings coming from a Bluetooth blood glucose meter as well.  

To enable automatic calibration, you need to enable Settings &#8722;> Less common settings &#8722;> Advanced Calibration &#8722;> Automatic Calibration, or  
Settings &#8722;> Glucose Meters &#8722;> Automatic Calibration.  
  
It's not a good idea to use automatic calibration for Dexcom G6.  The G6 calibration is handled by the transmitter itself.    
You can also see [here](https://www.dexcom.com/faqs/is-my-dexcom-sensor-accurate) why the manufacturer advises against over-calibrating.
