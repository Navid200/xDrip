### What is Calibration  
Current continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology measures glucose in interstitial fluid, which differs from blood glucose levels but is correlated. A formula translates interstitial fluid glucose to estimated blood glucose.

Calibration involves providing your CGM with your blood glucose readings, measured with a glucose meter, to help it establish this correlation. Ideally, more calibrations improve accuracy.  
  
### Factors Affecting Accuracy  
* **Accuracy of your blood glucose meter**: Ensure your meter is accurate and properly calibrated.  
* **Sensor Accuracy and Sensitivity**: The sensorâ€™s performance affects readings.  
* **Formula Accuracy**:  The formula used to correlate interstitial fluid glucose with blood glucose impacts results.  
* **Delay**: Blood glucose levels change before interstitial fluid glucose reflects those changes, with a typical delay of about 10 minutes.

Calibrating during rapid glucose changes can degrade accuracy.  
  
### Factory-calibrated CGMs  
The G6 sensor offers factory calibration, eliminating the need for regular calibrations after entering a 4-digit code at startup.  This is based on average error studies, but individual variations may occur.   If discrepancies arise, you can still calibrate.  
Always test with a glucose meter if symptoms do not match CGM readings.

### When to test your blood glucose  
Just because you test your blood glucose with your meter doesn't mean you have to calibrate.  You should test whenever your symptoms disagree with what the CGM shows.  

### When to calibrate  
If you use a G5, you should calibrate twice a day.  
If you use a G6, you don't have to calibrate.  But, if you find the readings to be incorrect, you can calibrate.  

Avoid calibrating when the glucose is changing rapidly.  Ideally, you should only calibrate when the trend is flat.  If you are using G5 or if you use the no-code mode for a G6, you will need to enter initial calibrations.  You don't have readings when you need to enter initial calibrations.  So, how would you know if your trend is flat?  You can ignore this requirement in this case only.  You can use your statistics AGP graph to see what time of day you have less rapid variations and start your sensor such that 2 hours after coincides with it.  This may not always be possible.  But, if it is, it helps accuracy.
  
### How to calibrate  
You can calibrate by selecting "Add Calibration" from the top left menu.
