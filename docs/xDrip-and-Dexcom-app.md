You cannot use both xDrip and the Dexcom app, or the modified Dexcom app, to collect from the same transmitter at the same time.  You have to choose one or the other.  

|Combination  | Resolution |

\*    You can use both xDrip and the Dexcom app if only Dexcom app is collecting from the same transmitter.  In that case, you can use xDrip as a [follower](./Follow_page) of the Dexcom app.
