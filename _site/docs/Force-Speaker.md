Why does the music blast my ears when I am listening to music using my headphones and an alert triggers?  

This may be because you have disabled "Force Speaker" making xDrip use the media channel instead of the alarm channel.  
Go to Settings &#8722;> Alarms and Alerts &#8722;> Glucose Level Alert List.  
Long press on the alert that is causing the problem to open the edit alert menu.  Scroll all the way down and enable "Force Speaker".  
Save Alert.  
Now, the alert will use the alarm channel instead of the media channel.
