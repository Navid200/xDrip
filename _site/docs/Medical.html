As soon as you place the transmitter in a sensor, or even if you just touch the contacts long enough, the counter (on the transmitter) starts counting the number of days.  Since the number of days you can use a transmitter is limited, don’t start the counter unless you intend to start using the transmitter.  The best practice is to keep the transmitter in the box until you intend to use it. Don’t start a sensor on a new G6 transmitter before voltages are shown. Only start a sensor after you have established connectivity, and can see the voltages reported on the system status page as explained. When you first establish connectivity to a transmitter, it will take a few read cycles for everything to be properly synced.  You can start a sensor right away.  You shouldn’t! See the details. Don’t start a G6 sensor unless …Before you start a sensor, the transmitter must have been outside a sensor for at least 10 minutes.  Otherwise, the transmitter will conclude that you are attempting to restart and will fail. A mistake some make with G6 is to place a new sensor on with the previous sensor still running.  Then, they stop the old sensor, remove the transmitter and snap it into the new sensor, right away, and start.  Even though the sensor is a new sensor, since the transmitter has not been kept out of both sensors for at least 10 minutes, the transmitter will stop the new sensor and issue an error. Don’t calibrate to correct more than a 20% error in one shot. Otherwise, you may get a confused calibration error.  Please calibrate as explained here. When you get a new phone, … Don’t forget to disable collection on the old phone.  Otherwise, both phones will have constant connectivity issues. Don’t restart a G6 sensor unless you understand the risks and accept responsibility for the possible consequences.  The manufacturer does not approve of restarting sensors.  You need to read all the details and consequences of a restart and understand that the readings will be incorrect after a restart.  I don’t encourage anyone to restart sensors, or anything else the manufacturer does not approve. "

You can tap on the magnifying glass symbol to search and search for volt.  That only shows the battery voltage logs. The voltages vary from transmitter to transmitter.

You should not over-calibrate G6.  Even the manufacturer tells you that. You should use an xDrip release not older than the current stable release.  You can see how to update here. To calibrate, tap on “Add Calibration” from the top left menu on the main screen.  After starting, or restarting, a sensor, you will have to wait to have at least 3 readings before this option appears. You should only calibrate when the trend is flat or at least, very close to flat. You should never enter a calibration that would attempt to perform a correction greater than 20% of the current reading.  For example, if the reading is 10. 0, you can calibrate to 8. 0 even if your blood glucose meter shows 7. 0. To perform multiple consecutive calibrations to achieve the required, greater, correction, you need to space the consecutive calibrations by at least 25 minutes.  If you want to calibrate a third time, delay the third one even more (45 minutes). If you don’t follow those recommendations, you may get a confused calibration error.  You will then have to wait hours and hope that the readings may come back.  The problem is that there is no way to know how long you need to wait.  So, the best course of action is to avoid causing that error. Ideally, you will not need to calibrate a G6.  If you are new to G6, you should give it (factory calibration) a chance. "

You can see the update procedure here. Your readings will start after the warm up and will be significantly higher than the correct values.  Please don’t take insulin to remedy that.  If you have a closed-loop system, please open the loop.    To calibrate, tap on “Add Calibration” from the top left menu button on the main screen.     If you calibrate to correct the large error in one shot, you may get a confused calibration error, which stops readings and may never come back.  To avoid that, you should limit the correction to 20% of the reading, and delay the second calibration to 25 minutes after the first.  For example, if the readings are at 10mmol/L (180mg/dL) and your glucose meter shows 6. 0 (108), you should calibrate to 8. 0 (144) instead of 6. 0 (108).  20% of 10 (180) is 2 (36).  Correcting by 20% means calibrating to 10 - 2 = 8 (180 - 36 = 144).  Another way of calculating this is to multiply 10 by 0. 8 to get 8 (multiply 180 by 0. 8 to get 144).  Two calibrations should bring the readings close enough.  If you insist to perform a third, delay it by 45 minutes from the second.     Only calibrate when the trend is flat or close to flat.     You will see logs containing “Received backfill packet out of sequence”, which you can ignore.     The following image shows how two consecutive calibrations were used to bring the readings close enough to the correct values after a restart.

    "title": "Calibration",
    "body": "Calibration: xDrip » Features » Calibration What is Calibration: The current continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology is limited to measuring glucose in interstitial fluid.  But, the glucose level in blood is not the same as the glucose level in interstitial fluid.  Fortunately, they are correlated.  A formula is used to calculate blood glucose from the measured interstitial fluid glucose. The CGM measures the interstitial fluid glucose.  We calibrate, by telling the CGM what our blood glucose is, after measuring it using our blood glucose meter.   The CGM uses these two figures to formulate the relationship. If everything was perfect, the more calibrations we performed, the more accurate the calibrated readings would become. What could affect the accuracy of the readings:  The accuracy of your blood glucose meter The accuracy and sensitivity of the sensor The accuracy of the formulaDelay: The blood glucose is the cause.  The interstitial fluid glucose is the effect.  The blood glucose is not always constant.  There is a delay (about 15 minutes) from when the blood glucose changes until the interstitial fluid glucose changes accordingly. This delay complicates the matter.  You can see a good description here. If your blood glucose is rapidly increasing, or decreasing, what your CGM shows will be very different than what your blood glucose is at the time. Therefore, you should never calibrate when the glucose is changing rapidly.  If you do, you could actually degrade accuracy instead of improving it. Factory-calibrated CGM: G6 offers factory calibration, which means the user does not need to perform calibrations anymore after entering a 4-digit calibration code when starting the sensor.  However, this is based on studies that have minimized the average error.  Some individuals may be farther from the average.  G6 allows you to calibrate if you need to. Regardless, it is a good idea to test with your blood glucose meter if your symptoms disagree with what the CGM shows. When to test your blood glucose: Just because you test your blood glucose with your meter doesn’t mean you have to calibrate.  You should test whenever your symptoms disagree with what the CGM shows. When to calibrate: If you use a G5, you should calibrate twice a day. If you use a G6, you don’t have to calibrate.  But, if you find the readings to be incorrect, you can calibrate. Avoid calibrating when the glucose is changing rapidly.  Ideally, you should only calibrate when the trend is flat.  If you are using G5 or if you use the no-code mode for a G6, you will need to enter initial calibrations.  You don’t have readings when you need to enter initial calibrations.  So, how would you know if your trend is flat? You can ignore this requirement in this case only.  You can use your statistics AGP graph to see what time of day you have less rapid variations and start your sensor such that 2 hours after coincides with it.  This may not always be possible.  But, if it is, it helps accuracy. How to calibrate: You can calibrate by selecting “Add Calibration” from the top left menu. Automatic Calibration: "

For example “No readings”, or “Sensor Stopped”. Also, state if there is something that has changed. For example, is this a new phone, or did you recently receive an Android patch, if the problem only occurs with a particular release of xDrip, or if you are new to xDrip, or if a new sensor started the issue. Please don’t open an issue. Please allow us to manage the issues.  There used to be too many issues opened up by users.  Many could just be addressed by using xDrip differently.  In the meantime, there were always too many open issues and there was no way for the developers to know which ones were real. Please help us manage the issues more efficiently by opening a discussion instead of an issue.  If it turns out to be an issue, we will convert the discussion into an issue, or ask you to open an issue.  Please only open an issue if asked by a developer. What you shouldn’t include: Items like user IDs, passwords, serial numbers, full name, address, phone number etc. can identify you or something that belongs to you.  We don’t need any of those in order to help you.  Some of those information may be included in xDrip logs or shown on status pages.  You can blackout such information before posting. On the other hand, the xDrip version you are using or the firmware version of the transmitter you are using are very important and can be relevant and will not compromise your privacy.  So, please include those. Suggestions: To reach out to developers, post in the discussions. xDrip is constantly being improved and your suggestions are welcome.  But, please note that there is a price to pay for every new feature.  xDrip needs to be maintained and documented.  That means xDrip bugs need to be fixed.  The more features there are, the more complicated the bugs will become. Please post your suggestions.  But, please be patient.

The first date is the date of manufacture. The second date is either a Ship-By or a Use-By Date. If the Ship-By or Use-By date is passed, you should not accept the transmitter. It would be like receiving a box of insulin with a passed expiry date. In addition, the warranty is valid only if you start using the transmitter less than 5 months from the date it was sent to you. Don’t remove a transmitter from the box unless you intend to use it. As soon as you snap in the transmitter into a sensor, or just touch the contacts for a while, an internal counter starts counting the number of days. You cannot stop it. The last day you can start, or restart, a sensor in native mode is day 99 for a G6 and day 105 for a G5. Uninstall Dexcom app: You cannot have both xDrip and Dexcom app (or modified Dexcom app) receiving directly from the same transmitter at the same time. You can use one or the other. If you want to use xDrip, you should ideally uninstall the Dexcom app first. If you need to use both, only the Dexcom app can be a collector and xDrip must be a follower. Phone Time Accuracy: Sync your phone clock to the network (Android Settings −&gt; System −&gt; Date &amp; Time). If you don’t, the transmitter could malfunction and it will not be easy to figure out why. Battery Optimization: Disable battery optimization of xDrip in Android. Generally, this is at Android settings −&gt; Apps −&gt; xDrip+ −&gt; Advanced −&gt; Battery. However, depending on device and Android version, you may need to look elsewhere or disable more than one item. It’s best to search online for how to disable battery optimization on your device. Bluetooth Battery Optimization: Disable Bluetooth battery optimization in Android. Generally, to access this setting, you should go to Android Settings −&gt; Apps &amp; notifications. Tap on “See all apps” if needed to see a list.  Tap on the “Show system apps” from the 3 dot menu. Scroll down to Bluetooth and tap on Bluetooth −&gt; Advanced −&gt; Battery.  Disable battery optimization. Location and Bluetooth: In Android, you should have Location and Bluetooth active. If you put your phone in Airplane mode, you need to enable Bluetooth if you want xDrip to continue to work. For Android 11, you should enable background location access. Android Settings −&gt; App Settings −&gt; xDrip −&gt; LocationChoose “Allow all the time”. Don’t initiate Android pair: Don’t attempt to pair your transmitter from Android Bluetooth settings page. Allow xDrip to trigger an Android pair request. Give permission when requested. Don’t look under the list of paired devices expecting to see your transmitter. The transmitter only transmits a short burst once every 5 minutes. Most of the time, the transmitter is silent. Therefore, Android may show your transmitter as something that was, rather than is, paired. System Status: Access the System Status page from the top left menu. There, you can swipe left and right to access two different system status pages, when collecting from a Dexcom transmitter, with headings “Classic Status Page” and “G5/G6 Status”. The Classic Status page shows the xDrip version including date. The G5/G6 Status Page contains important parameters including transmitter ID, time from last connection, firmware version, number of days on the transmitter, and transmitter battery voltages. Connectivity: xDrip will not work if there is no proper connectivity. If there is no proper connectivity, you should not start a sensor. Neither should you attempt to perform a hard reset, calibrate, or stop sensor. You need to first solve the connectivity issue. Most likely, your xDrip settings are incorrect. "

You started using the transmitter less than 5 months after receiving it. The warranty covers proper operation for an uninterrupted period of 90 days.

If you want to change the slot number xDrip uses, you first need to enable engineering mode. Then, if you access Settings −&gt; G5/G6 Debug Settings, you will see a setting titled “Manual Slot Number”, which you can edit. To force xDrip to use the non-default slot number, set that to 1. If you disable engineering mode, it will use the default setting. If you want to go back to the default setting, in engineering mode, set it to 2.

You can also hard reset a G6 with a serial number that starts with 81 if the Firmware version is 1. 6. 5. 25 or prior to that. At this point, there is no way to hard reset any other one of G6 transmitters. If you hard reset a transmitter, the number of transmitter days, as shown on the system status page, will be reset to 0. This is only required if you want to use the Native mode, or if you want to use the Dexcom app or receiver. If you are using the xDrip non-native mode, you don’t need to hard reset. If the battery voltage is low, you will need to replace the battery. Hard resetting the transmitter will not change the battery voltage. If you want to hard reset, do it when you don’t have an active session. For example, when you stop a sensor before starting the next one. Before you can hard reset a transmitter using xDrip, you need to have proper connectivity to it. You should also disable the Dexcom app as you cannot link to the same transmitter at the same time with both xDrip and the Dexcom app. Tap on the treatment (dropper) symbol on the main screen. This opens a form mainly showing a numeric pad. At the bottom right corner, long press on the microphone symbol. A keyboard will appear. Type “Hard Reset Transmitter” without the quotes.  You will see a message confirming the attempt will be made. Monitor the system status page. It will take several read cycles (5 minutes each) for the messages in the queue to clear.

Therefore, it cannot be used in non-native mode.  All G5 transmitters can be used in either native or non-native mode. Native mode is automatically enabled for a G6 except in engineering mode. *** In native mode, calibration is done by the transmitter.  If you see a calibration graph, it is because the transmitter sends raw values also.  But, the graph does not represent the calibration formula.  Clearing calibrations in native mode will have no impact on the effective calibration formula. "

    "body": "Transfer to a new phone: xDrip » Download &amp; Installation » Transfer to a new phone If you like to have your previous readings on your new phone, this is about how you should do it. Be very careful. xDrip cannot import a database.  It has a restore database function.  What it does is to replace the existing database with the one being restored. Effectively, xDrip deletes the entire existing database and then replaces it with the new database. The best course of action is to restore the database into the new phone before setting it up as a collector.  Otherwise, if you start collection on the new phone, restoring a database after will overwrite every collection.  The following list shows the recommended order.  Export the database from the old phone.  Install xDrip on the new phone.  Transfer the exported database to the new phone.  You can email it to yourself, or use a USB cable and a computer.  Create an xdrip folder on the new phone, if it doesn’t exist, and place the database file in it.  Restore the database only if you have not already started collection, or if you are willing to lose the new readings. This will restore the readings history and your alerts.  Set up the new phone as your new collector.  You should disable collection on the old phone first.  If you want to bring in more settings from the old phone, you need to load the settings file from the old phone as well. This is not meant to convince you to use your phone as a repository of all your previous readings.  A better repository for your readings is Nightscout.  Because it is independent of your phone, which you may replace or lose.  You can use Nightscout to access previous readings and perform statistical analyses and use them for creating reports.  But, it’s meant to let you bring in your reaadings etc. from your old phone to the new one if you choose to. "

The other is at the bottom containing “Submit” and “Cancel” in this case identified by a green enclosing marker.  Ideally, you would be able to use the mouse to click on submit or cancel.  Unfortunately, we cannot use the mouse.  Therefore, we need to use the keyboard for the area at the bottom as well. When you first see a menu, the cursor is in the first area at the top.  You can move between the User ID and Password using the up and down arrow keys.  But, you cannot move the cursor to submit or cancel by pressing the up or down arrow keys.  To do that, you will need to press the TAB key.  After you do that, you can use the left and right arrow keys to move between “Submit” and “Cancel”.

On the other hand, if you have changed your mind and would like to cancel, you can just press the escape key. The file selection menu is shown in the following image. In that case, after you move the cursor over the file name you want to choose, you will need to use the spacebar.  Pressing enter will not select the file.  After selecting the file using the spacebar, the file name will appear in the full path at the bottom.  Then, you need to press ENTER to submit. You will also see notifications.

Also, giving the world permission to access your site may allow crawlers to access it, which will increase traffic.  In order to keep your Nighsctout project in free tier, you need to minimize traffic. Setting up Nightscout tokens for your followers: Use a web browser to access your Nightscout (https://hostname) and authenticate again if needed (see Setting up Nightscout). Click on the top right menu button and select “Admin Tools”. Click on “Add new Subject”. In the form that opens, enter a name.  under “Roles”, copy roles from the table below it.  For example, for a follower that is only supposed to see readings and nothing else, only enter “readable” without quotes as you can see in the previous image.  You can enter a combination of different roles by separating them with “,”. You can add an optional comment and save.  Take note of the access token. An example token that can only read is shown below. You can create multiple tokens with specific permissions for each to use for different followers. Setting up xDrip as a follower: In the follower xDrip, choose “Nightscout Follower” as the hardware data source. Under “Nightscout Follow URL”, enter https://Token@hostname assuming Token is the token you generated as explained above, and hostname is your FreeDNS hostname. If it doesn’t work, try the following in a browser on the follower phone, where Token is the token you generated as explained above.  If it doesn’t work, the token may be wrong. https://hostname/?token=Token "

We reached out to our head developer, JamOrHam, for advice and the following was his response. In terms of security, the google cloud vps only has web port open. Google manage the ssh keys. The web port has a nginx front-end using openssl and node-js. These are the main critical attack surfaces and these components power half of the internet and we have automatic updates enabled for them. So, any vulnerability will be automatically patched. They are very widely tested and mature products with very strong security. Then there is nightscout and the modules it contains. Any vulnerability there would basically be the same for any nightscout installation and if there were a critical vulnerability, we would expect to hear about it. It could also be patched. The most likely issue would be password security which is also the same for any method of deploying nightscout and the responsibility of the user. I seriously doubt that any random hacker who managed to defeat all of those defenses would even be interested in delivering a remote bolus maliciously. The only people who would be interested in that would be someone known to the user or security researchers. Random hackers would be far more interested in trying to steal money or send spam.  Google totally block all outbound email and we do not use any cloud credentials on the vps so they can’t use the vps to set up more vps for bitcoin mining or something. It is definitely worth making sure we haven’t made any mistakes with the installation but as far as I know the nightscout authentication controls work and so I’m not sure what else we would need to check.

Noise is the rapid oscillatory fluctuation of readings that is due to the sensor malfunction rather than a real representation of your blood glucose. Please look at the readings in the following image. According to the readings, the blood glucose increases from reading A to the following reading marked with B.  Then, the blood glucose decreases from reading B to the following reading marked with C.  But, the time sequence between these readings is only 5 minutes.  Your blood glucose never fluctuates that fast. This is obviously caused by the malfunction of the sensor (noise).  In this case, you can either switch to a new sensor or will have to put up with the ups and downs until you do. "

Don’t wipe them off. Don’t let dust or any other material get into it. You should wait a minute or two to make sure there is no bleeding. If there is, use Q-tips to absorb the blood and keep doing it until bleeding stops. If blood gets into the contacts, it could compromise the insulation of the two contacts resulting in erroneous low readings. After cleaning the transmitter contacts (not the sensor) snap in the transmitter. Doing so causes the substance to spread around the contacts. It provides a barrier, against moisture, around the contacts. In order to restart a G6 sensor, we remove the transmitter and later snap it back in. When doing that, don’t wipe away the substance from the transmitter contacts. While the transmitter is out, cover the transmitter and sensor to protect the substance from contaminants like dust or being accidentally wiped away by your clothes.  "

This guide explains how you can remove the transmitter leaving the sensor intact and still attached to you. A G6 transmitter is shown in the following figure, in which the sensor prong latch is marked. A sensor is shown in the following figure. The flexible material puts pressure on the transmitter.  When snapping in the transmitter, the resistance you sense is from this material. When the transmitter is properly seated into the sensor, the two sensor prongs latch into the sides of the transmitter, and the contacts and their surrounding material keep the transmitter tightly in place. To remove the transmitter, we need to gently push the prongs away from the transmitter.  We can do that using a very thin but sturdy object.  The following shows how you can use the plastic packaging of a sensor for creating such a tool. Use scissors to cut the section highlighted in the following figure from the top of a G6 sensor plastic package. Use sharp scissors to round the two corners.  Now, we have our tool.  Please keep away from children, or pets, as this is small and can be a choking hazard. The following figure shows an image of the transmitter snapped into the sensor. You can see the prong snapped in in the following figure. If you gently insert the larger end of the plastic strip, with rounded corners, between the sensor and transmitter where the prong is located, the prong will release as shown in the next figure.  This is because of the compressed flexible material between the sensor and the transmitter.  The material pushes the transmitter away from the sensor.  This is why it is enough to just release the prong.  Then, the transmitter is tilted and the prong will never snap back in unless you apply pressure on top of the transmitter, which you shouldn’t if you want to remove the transmitter. The following clip shows how the transmitter can be removed using the tool we created.  Gently insert the plastic strip between the transmitter and the sensor on one side as shown until you hear or feel a click. Then, do the same on the other side.  "

You should not restart if you are not aware of the risks and consequences. Your readings will be significantly high in error after warm-up after a restart.  If you ignore this and take insulin to lower your readings, you will cause hypoglycemia.  Similarly, if you have a closed loop system and do not open the loop while readings are wrong, the loop will inject insulin, to correct the erroneous High, and cause hypoglycemia.  Please read the entire page and follow the required calibration steps. If the first two characters of the transmitter serial number are 80, or if they are 81 and the firmware version is 1. 6. 5. 25 or prior to that, you can use preemptive restart.  Then, you will not need to restart.  Preemptive restart will automatically restart the sensor and you will not need to restart manually. Ensure settings are correct first.  If your sensor has unexpectedly stopped, restarting will not resolve the underlying problem.  You should resolve any connectivity issues first and verify that you have proper connectivity.  You don’t need to restart before the sensor stops on day 10.  You can, but, you don’t have to. You can use the original calibration code for restart or you can restart in no-code mode.  But, there are reports of malfunction in attempting to restart in no-code mode.  So, my recommended approach is to use the original calibration code as described below.  Tap on stop sensor (top left menu). Tap on “STOP SENSOR”.  You should do this even if the sensor has already stopped if the “start sensor” option is not available. Wait 5 minutes.  If day 10 has ended and the sensor has already stopped, and the “Start Sensor” option is already available under the top left menu, you can skip step 1.  Remove the transmitter without causing damage to the sensor (see how).  There is petroleum jelly on the transmitter and sensor contacts. Don’t wipe it off.  Wait 15 minutes from when you removed the transmitter. After you stopped sensor, there would be “stop sensor” in a queue item on the G5/G6 status page. The queue would clear in about 10 to 15 minutes. Then, you would see Sensor: Stopped on the G5/G6 status page. If you had a sensor start failed message, you may still see that message instead. Only after the “stop sensor” note has cleared the queue should you proceed.  Snap the transmitter back into the sensor.  Start Sensor.  Enter the original calibration code when asked.  After the 2-hour warm-up, your readings will be significantly high in error (*).  You will need to calibrate.  You should calibrate in small steps to avoid a confused calibration error (see how). * When we restart a G6 sensor, we fool the transmitter to think that we are starting a new sensor.  If we use the original calibration code, the transmitter thinks the sensor is on day 1 when in reality, the sensor is on day 11 if we restarted after 10 days.  The impact of the immune system on the sensor is different on day 1 versus day 11.  This discrepancy results in incorrect high readings after warm-up. The manufacturer does not approve the restart of sensors. As a sensor ages, the accuracy diminishes. You should occasionally check your blood glucose, with your glucose meter, to verify accuracy, and calibrate to reduce error when needed. Eventually, the noise level may increase as well. Noise is the rapid oscillatory fluctuation of readings that is not a real representation of your blood glucose. "

Please follow the steps exactly as stated below, in the specified sequence, to avoid common issues. If you see references here to functions you don’t recognize, please have a look at this. If you have been using the Dexcom app, you need to disable it.  You cannot have two mobile apps collecting from the same transmitter at the same time.    If you are using an old version of xDrip, update to the current stable release.     Set “G5/G6 Transmitter” under   Settings −&gt; Hardware Data Source.     Is there a “Start G6 Sensor” stuck in the queue on the G5/G6 status page? Please note that in the last step when you start sensor, there will be a “Start G6 Sensor” in the queue for one read cycle (up to 5 minutes).  That is expected and does not count as a stuck command.  A stuck command remains in the queue and does not clear. If there is a command stuck in the queue, clear the queue.     Adjust xDrip settings.  If you get a pair request at any point, please approve.     If “Start Sensor” isn’t available as an option from the top left menu on the main screen, “Stop Sensor” from the same menu.  Wait 5 minutes.  The transmitter needs to be detached from your body for at least 10 minutes before you proceed. If there is bleeding, after inserting a new sensor, use Q-tips to absorb the blood.  Keep doing that, and don’t allow any blood to get to the contacts, until bleeding stops.     If you are starting a new transmitter, enter the new transmitter serial number (Transmitter ID): Settings −&gt; Dexcom Transmitter ID.     Clean the transmitter contacts (not if you are restarting sensor) using rubbing alcohol.  Wait for it (10 seconds) to dry.  Snap the transmitter into the sensor.  If you are starting a new transmitter, snapping it into the sensor on your body is required to activate it.   Monitor the G5/G6 system status page. Every 5 minutes, a read cycle completes. If you don’t have proper connectivity, don’t proceed before figuring out why. Perhaps, your settings are incorrect. If you are starting a new transmitter, be patient and wait for the battery voltages to be populated before you proceed.  It may take up to half an hour.  Start sensor.  Enter the 4-digit calibration code from the sensor adhesive cover when asked. Keep the code. In 2 hours, your readings will start with no need for initial calibrations. To see all the guides and notes about using xDrip for Dexcom, please see this.  If you have a question that is not covered, please tell us. If you are coming from G5, or another CGM, you need to get used to factory calibration.  Give it a chance.  Most people don’t need to calibrate a new G6 sensor as long as the calibration code is entered properly. A common mistake is to replace an old transmitter with a new one, stop sensor, change transmitter ID, and start sensor right away. This could result in the new transmitter never receiving the start command at the right time. The outcome is no readings after the 2-hour warm-up. Never soak (insert sensor a while before starting it) a G6 sensor. The main advantage of G6 over G5 is factory calibration. You will be interfering with factory calibration (accuracy) the longer it takes from the moment you insert the sensor to the moment you start the sensor in xDrip. "

So, only start the counter if you intend to use the transmitter.  The counter starts counting as soon as you insert the transmitter in a sensor.  It could even start if you hold the trasnsmitter in your hand touching the contacts for a while.  So, it’s best to keep the transmitter in the box until you intend to start using it. The last day you can start (or restart) a sensor on a transmitter in native mode is when the system status page shows 99 (105 for G5) for “Transmitter Days”.  After you successfully start a sensor, it will work for 10 days (7 days for G5 in native mode). Hard resetting a transmitter does nothing to the battery.

It is practically impossible to fully and adequately test a piece of software.  Some bugs will be found by users after release.  That’s why releases are made in stages. A pre-release is a release that has only been tested by the developers.  We call it a Nightly release. On average, there is a Nightly release once a week. You can download the nightly builds (least tested but most recent), from “releases” under the “Releases” heading (shown below) on the GitHub repository page.

Make sure developer mode is enabled on the Watch Make sure that wifi adb debugging is enabled Go to xDrip Prefs on the Watch, scroll till you see Force Update - tap it It should check ADB, and ask for authorization, select Always Allow Probably it will tell you ADB isn’t working due to needing the authorization Go in to xDrip Prefs again on the watch and click Force Update This time it should say ADB looks good and then ask xDrip phone app to send the latest version This should download and then xDrip will install itself. Because the versions are currently identical then this wont really do much, but this process can be used to force xDrip to send the latest version in future but it should also automatically detect version changes and update in the background. For fun you could install the latest nightly on the watch then downgrade your phone and check that the update process then downgrades your watch app version. The version information should be displayed next to the Force Update text. The idea is that you no longer need to use Wear Installer or whatever method you used to install the first time around (eg PC based adb or downgrading play store) as xDrip can update itself. "
