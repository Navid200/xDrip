## Custom sound/alarm grayed out
[xDrip](../README.md) >> [Troubleshooting](./Troubleshooting_page) >> Custom sound/alarm grayed out  
  
On the "Edit Alert" page, if you tap on "Choose file" and select "Custom Sound/Alert" and navigate to an mp3 file on your device, you may see that it is grayed out.  
This is a known issue and will hopefully be addressed soon.  

To use a custom file, you can use these [instructions](./Custom-Alert-Sound.md).
