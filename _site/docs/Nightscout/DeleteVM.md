## Delete virtual machine
[xDrip](../../README.md) >> [Features](../Features_page) >> [Nightscout](../Nightscout_page) >> [Nightscout on Google Cloud](./GoogleCloud) >> Delete virtual machine  
  
**Warning!:** If you delete a virtual machine, all the data on the virtual machine, including your MongoDB, will be deleted.  There will be no way to undo that.  
It is a good idea to [backup the database](./DatabaseBackup.md) as well as your Nightscout variables (/etc/nsconfig) before proceeding.  
  
If you have just created the machine, you can delete it with no worries as you have not added any data to the machine.  
  
Go to the [Compute Engine](./ComputeEngine.md).  
  
Choose "Delete" from the 3-dot menu.
