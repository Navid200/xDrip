You will need a credit card to [set up billing](./NS_GCProject.md). This will be free as long as you don't have too much outgoing traffic (more than 1GB per month) from your Google Cloud server. Regardless, a credit card is required.
If you have a follower who is in Australia or China, the data traffic from your server to them will not qualify for [Free Tier](./NS_FreeTier.md).
